now i notice that some foreign peoples use certain plants on their persons both to make themselves more handsome and also to keep up traditional custom. at any rate among barbarian tribes the women stain the face, using, some one plant and some another; and the men too among the daci and the sarmatae tattoo their own bodies. in gaul there is a plant like the plantain, called glastum; with it the wives of the britons, and their daughters-in-law, stain all the body, and at certain religious ceremonies march along naked, with a colour resembling that of ethiopians.
