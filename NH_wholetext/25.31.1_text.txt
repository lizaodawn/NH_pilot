there is a second centaury, surnamed lepton, a plant with small leaves; some call it libadion, because it grows along the side of springs. it is like origanum but with narrower and longer leaves; it has an angular, bushy stem a span high, a flower like that of lychnis, a slight root of no use in medicine, but with healing qualities in its juice. the plant itself is gathered in autumn, and the juice is extracted from the leaves. some cut up and soak the stems, extracting the juice at the end of eighteen days. this centaury the romans call the 'gall of earth' on account of its extreme bitterness, while the gauls call it exacum, because a draught of it evacuates from the body by stool all harmful drugs.
