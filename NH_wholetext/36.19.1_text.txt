we must mention also the labyrinths, quite the most abnormal achievement on which man has spent his resources, but by no means a fictitious one, as might well be supposed. one still exists in egypt, in the nome of heracleopolis. this, the first ever to be constructed, was built, according to tradition, 3600 years ago by king petesuchis or king tithoes, although herodotus attributes the whole work to the 'twelve kings,' the last of whom was psammetichus. various reasons are suggested for its construction. demoteles supposes it to have been the palace of moteris, and lyceas the tomb of moeris, while many writers state that it was erected as a temple to the sun-god, and this is the general belief. whatever the truth may be, there is no doubt that daedalus adopted it as the model for the labyrinth built by him in crete but that he reproduced only a hundredth part of it containing passages that wind, advance and retreat in a bewilderingly intricate manner. it is not just a narrow strip of ground comprising many miles 'walks' or 'rides,' such as we see exemplified in our tessellated floors or in the ceremonial game played by our boys in the campus martius but doors are let into the walls at frequent intervals to suggest deceptively the way ahead and to force the visitor to go back upon the very same tracks that he has already followed in his wanderings. this cretan labyrinth was the next in succession after the egyptian, and there was a third in lemnos and a fourth in italy, all alike being roofed with vaults of carefully worked stone. there is a feature of the egyptian labyrinth which i for my me part find surprising, namely an entrance and columns made of parian marble. the rest of the structure is of syene granite, the great blocks of which have been laid in such a way that even the lapse of centuries cannot destroy them. their preservation has been aided by the people of heracleopolis, who have shown remarkable respect for an achievement that they detest.
