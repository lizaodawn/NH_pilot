the big cedrus, which they call cedrelate, yields a pitch which is called cedria, very useful for toothache; for it breaks the teeth and brings them out, easing the pain. i have already described how cedrus juice is extracted from the wood, of great use for book-rolls were it not for the headache it causes. it preserves dead bodies uncorrupted by time, but causes living ones to decay â€” a strange inconsistency, to rob the living of their life and to give a quasi-life to the dead! it also makes clothes decay and kills animal life. for this reason i should not think it ought to be used as a remedy for quinsy, or for indigestion, as some have recommended, taken by the mouth. i should also be afraid to rinse the teeth with it in vinegar, when they ache, or to drop it into the ears for hardness of hearing or worms. gossip records a miracle: that to rub it all over the male part before coition prevents conception. i should not hesitate to use it as an ointment for phthiriasis or for scurf. it is also recommended to take it in raisin wine to counteract the poison of the sea hare, but more readily it might be used as liniment for leprosy. for foul sores and excrescences in them, and for spots and films on the eyes, certain authorities have prescribed it as an ointment, and have directed that a cyathus of it be drunk for sores on the lung, as well as for tapeworm. there is prepared from it an oil also, which they call 'pisselaeoni' used for all the same purposes, but of greater potency. it is well ascertained that snakes are kept away by the sawdust of cedrus, and that to rub the body with the crushed berries mixed with oil has the same result.
