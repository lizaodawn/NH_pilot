in the island of siphnos there is a stone that is hollowed out and turned on the lathe so as to form cooking utensils or tableware; and this i myself know to be the case also with the green stone of como in italy. the siphnian stone, however, has a peculiarity of its own in that when thoroughly heated with oil it becomes black and hard, whereas naturally it is very soft. such are the divers properties to be found in one substance. incidentally, exceptional instances of soft stones occur beyond the alps. in the province of belgic gaul a white stone is said to be cut with a saw, just like wood, only even more easily, so as to serve as ordinary roof tiles and as rain tiles or, if so desired, as the kind of roofing known as 'peacock-style.'
