the drones have no stings, being so to say imperfect bees and the newest made, the incomplete product of those that are exhausted and now discharged from service, a late brood, and as it were the servants of the true bees, who consequently order them about, and drive them out first to the works, punishing laggards without mercy. and the drones are of service to the bees not only in work but also when breeding, as their crowd contributes much to their warmth: it is certain that the larger number of drones there has been, the larger production of swarms also occurs. when the honey has begun to ripen, the bees drive the drones away, and falling on them many to one kill them. moreover this class of bee is only seen in spring. if a drone is stripped of its wings and afterwards thrown back into the hive it itself strips the wings off the others.
