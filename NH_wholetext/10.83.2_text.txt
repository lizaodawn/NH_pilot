species with the genital organs behind them, elephants, camels, tigers, lynxes, the rhinoceros the lion, the hairy-footed and the common rabbit couple back to back. camels even make for deserts or else places certain to be secret, and one is not allowed to interrupt them without disaster; the coupling lasts a whole day, and this is the case with these alone of all animals. with the solid-hooved species in the quadruped class the males are excited by scenting the female. also dogs, seals and wolves turn away in the middle of coupling and still remain coupled against their will. among the above-mentioned species, of hares the females usually cover first, but with all the others the males; but bears, as was said, couple, like human beings, lying down, hedgehogs both standing up and embracing each other, eats with the male standing and the female lying beneath it, foxes lying down on their sides and the female embracing the male. cows and does resent the violence of the bulls and stags, and consequently walk forward in pairing. stags pass across to other hinds and return to the former ones alternately. lizards like the creatures without feet practise intercourse by intertwining.
