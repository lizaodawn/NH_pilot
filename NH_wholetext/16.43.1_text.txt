in the case of some trees the fruit does not follow immediately. the cornel produces its fruit about midsummer; it is at first white and afterwards blood-red. the female of the same kind bears its berries after autumn; they are sour and no animal will touch them; also its wood is spongy and of no use, although the timber of the male tree is one of the strongest and hardest there is, so great is the difference caused by sex in the same kind of tree. the terebinth and also the maple and the ash produce their seed at harvest time, but nut-trees, apples and pears, excepting winter or early varieties, in the autumn, and the acorn-bearing trees still later, at the setting of the pleiades, the winter oak only in autumn, while some kinds of apple and pear and the cork-tree fruit at the beginning of winter. the fir flowers with a saffron-coloured blossom about midsummer and produces its seed after the setting of the pleiades; but the pine and the pitch-pine come before it in budding by about a fortnight, though they themselves also drop their seed after the pleiades.
