the one race of outstanding eminence in virtue among all the races in the whole world is undoubtedly the roman. what human being has had the greatest happiness is not a question for human judgement, since prosperity itself different people define in different ways and each according to his own temperament. if we wish to make a true judgement and discard all fortune's pomp in deciding the point, none among mortals is happy. fortune deals lavishly and makes an indulgent bargain with the man whom it is possible justly to pronounce not unhappy. in fact, apart from other considerations, assuredly there is a fear that fortune may grow weary, and this fear once entertained, happiness has no firm foundation. what of the proverb that none among mortals is wise all the time? and would that as many men as possible may deem this proverb false, and not as the utterance of a prophet! mortality, being so vain and so ingenious in self-deception, makes its calculation after the manner of the thracian tribe that puts stone counters of different colours corresponding to each day's experience in an urn, and on the last day sorts them and counts them out and thus pronounces judgement about each individual. what of the fact that the very day commended by that stone of brilliant whiteness contained the source of misfortune? how many men have been overthrown by attaining power! how many have been ruined and plunged into the direst torments by wealth! wealth forsooth it is called if a man has had an hour of joy while surrounded by it. so doubtless is it! different days pass verdict on different men and only the last day a final verdict on all men; and consequently no day is to be trusted. what of the fact that goods are not equal to evils even if of equal number, and that no joy can counterbalance the smallest grief? alas what vain and foolish application! we count the number of the days, when it is their weight that is in question!
