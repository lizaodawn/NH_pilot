the maple, which is of about the same size as the lime, is second only to the citrus in its elegance as a material for cabinet-making and in the finish it allows of. it is of several kinds: the white maple, an exceptionally light-coloured wood, is called gallic maple, and grows in italy north of the po, and on the other side of the alps; the second kind has blotches running in wavy lines, and in its finer variety has received the name of 'peacock maple' from its resemblance to a peacock's tail, the finest sorts growing in istria and raetia; and an inferior variety is called the thick-veined maple. the greeks distinguish the varieties by locality, saying that the maple of the plains is light-coloured and not wavy — this kind they call glinon — but the mountain maple has a rather wavy grain and is harder, the wood of the male tree being still wavier and suitable for making more elegant articles; while a third kind is the hornbeam, a reddish wood that splits easily, with a rough bark of a pale colour. others prefer to class tins as belonging to a special kind of tree, and give it the latin name of carpinus.
