limeum is the name given by the gauls to a plant that they use to make a drug, called by them deer poison, with which when hunting they poison their arrows. as much of the plant as is usually used for one arrow is mixed with three bushels of saliva stimulant, and when cattle are sick this mash is forced down their throats. afterwards they must be tied to their stalls until they are purged — for they usually go wild — and if sweating ensues cold water should be poured over them.
