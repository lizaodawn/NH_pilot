the whole system however is based on three lines of observation â€” the rising and the setting of the constellations and the periods of the seasons themselves: there are two modes of observing the risings and settings, as the stars are either hidden by the arrival of the sun and cease to be visible, or they present themselves to the view on the sun's departure (so that custom would have done better to designate the latter as the stars' 'emergence' rather than 'rising', and the former as their 'occultation' rather than 'setting'); or by means of the following mode by the day on which the risings and settings of the stars begin or cease to be visible at the rising or setting of the sun, these being designated their morning or evening risings and settings according as each of them occurs at dawn or at dusk. they require intervals of at least three-quarters of an hour before sunrise or after sunset in order to be visible. moreover there are some stars that rise and set twice; and all that is said here refers to the stars which we have stated to be fixed stars.
