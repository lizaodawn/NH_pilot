palms are also propagated by layering, the trunk for a length of three feet from the actual brain of the tree being divided by incisions and dug into the ground. also a slip torn off from the root makes a hardy growth when planted, and so does one from the youngest of the branches. in assyria the tree itself, too, is laid in a moist soil and throws out roots along its whole length, but these grow into shrubs and not into a tree; consequently the growers plant cuttings, and transplant the young trees when a year old and again when two years old, for they like a change of position â€” this is done in the spring in other countries, but in assyria about the rising of the dog-star. also there they do not touch the young trees with a knife, but tie back the leafy shoots to make them grow upward to a considerable height. when the trees are strong they prune them down so as to make them grow thicker, leaving the stumps of the branches six inches long; to lop them at any other point kills the mother tree. we have said above that palms like a salt soil; consequently in places where the ground is not of that nature they sprinkle salt on it, not at the roots of the trees but a little farther off. some palms in syria and egypt divide into two trunks, and in crete even into three, and some even into five. these begin to bear in three years, but the palms in cyprus, syria and egypt bear when four years old, and others when five, the tree being then the height of a man; as long as the trees are young the fruit has no woody part inside, and consequently they are called 'eunuchs.'
