for gardens the times for watering are in the morning and the evening, so that the water may not be heated by the sun. it only suits basil to water it at midday as well; for it is thought that this plant even when first sown will break out most rapidly if at the first stage it is watered with water that is warm. all plants grow better and larger when transplanted, most of all leeks and navews. also transplanting has a medicinal effect, and such plants as long onion, leek, radishes, parsley, lettuces, turnip and cucumber cease to suffer from injuries when transplanted. but almost all the wild varieties, for example savory, wild marjoram, rue, are smaller in leaf and stalk, and have a more acrid juice. indeed sorrel is the only one of all the plants of which the wild variety is the better, the cultivated sorrel is called rumix, and it is the strongest of all the plants grown under cultivation or wild; at all events it is reported that when once it has been established it lasts on and is never overcome, and that it is specially everlasting when close to water. it is only used for the table mixed with pearl-barley, which gives it a softer and more agreeable flavour. the wild variety supplies a number of drugs. (and so careful has research been to overlook nothing, that i actually find it stated in a poem that if the seeds of leek, rocket, lettuce, parsley, endive and cress are planted enclosed in hollow pellets of goat's dung, each seed in a separate pellet, they come up wonderfully. with plants of which there is also a wild variety, the latter are thought to be more dry and acrid than the cultivated sort.)
