hyenas occur most numerously in africa, which also produces a multitude of wild asses. in that species each male is lord of a separate herd of females. they are afraid of rivals in their affections, and consequently they keep a watch on their females when in foal, and geld their male offspring with a bite; to guard against this the females when in foal seek hiding-places and are anxious to give birth by stealth. also they are fond of a great deal of sexual indulgence.
