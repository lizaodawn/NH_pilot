osyris bears dark twigs, slender and pliant, on which are dark leaves like those of flax. the seed on the twigs is black to begin with, and then the colour changes to red. from them are made cosmetics for women. a decoction of the roots taken by the mouth cures jaundice. these roots also, if cut off before the seed ripens and dried in the sun, check looseness of the bowels; but, if dug up after the ripening and boiled down in gruel, they are good treatment for catarrhs of the belly, and by themselves they are beaten up and taken in rain water.
