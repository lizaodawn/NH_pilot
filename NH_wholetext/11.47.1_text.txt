of all the animals man has most hair on the head: indeed this is the case indiscriminately with males and females, at all events with the races that do not cut the hair; and the longhair tribes of the alps and gallia comata have actually derived their names from this, though nevertheless there is in this respect some difference between countries: in fact the people of mykoni are born devoid of hair, like the persons with an affection of the spleen at caucus. (also some kinds of animals are bald by nature, for instance ostriches and cormorants; the greek name for the latter is derived from this peculiarity.) with these races loss of the hair is rare in the case of a woman and unknown in eunuchs, and never occurs in any case before sexual intercourse has taken place; and they are never bald below the brainpan or the crown of the head, or round the temples and the ears. man is the only species in which baldness occurs, except in cases of animals born without hair, and only with human beings and horses does the hair turn grey, in the former case always starting at the forehead and only afterwards at the back of the head.
