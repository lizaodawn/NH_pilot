pancratium some prefer to call 'little squill.' it has leaves resembling those of the white lily, but longer and thicker, and a root like a large, red bulb. its juice taken with retch flour relaxes the bowels and cleans ulcers. with honey it is given for dropsy and affections of the spleen. others boil it down until the water becomes sweet, pour this off, pound the root, and work it into lozenges, which they dry in the sun and use afterwards for sores on the head and all other ailments that call for a detergent. moreover, they give in wine a three-finger pinch for cough, and an electuary made of it for pleurisy or pneumonia. they also give it to be taken in wine for sciatica, for colic, and as an emmenagogue.
