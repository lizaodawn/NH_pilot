there are also small birds with hooked claws, for instance the variety of woodpeckers called birds of mars that are important in taking auguries. in this class are the tree-hollowing woodpeckers that climb nearly straight upright in the manner of cats, but also the others that cling upside down, which know by the sound of the bark when they strike it that there is fodder underneath it. they are the only birds that rear their chicks in holes. there is a common belief that when wedges are driven into their holes by a shepherd the birds by applying a kind of grass make them slip out again. trebius states that if you drive a nail or wedge with as much force as you like into a tree in which a woodpecker has a nest, when the bird perches on it it at once springs out again with a creak of the tree. woodpeckers themselves have been of the first importance among auguries in latium from the time of the king a who gave his name to this bird. one presage of theirs i cannot pass over. when aelius tubero, city praetor, was giving judgements from the bench in the forum, a woodpecker perched on his head so fearlessly that he was able to catch it in his hand. in reply to enquiry the seers declared that disaster was portended to the empire if the bird were released, but to the praetor if it were killed. tubero however at once tore the bird in pieces; and not long afterwards he fulfilled the portent.
