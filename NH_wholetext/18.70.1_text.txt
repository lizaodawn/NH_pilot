when you have occasion for alarm, make bonfires about the vineyards and fields of trimmings or heaps of chaff and weeds and bushes that have been rooted up, and the smoke will act as a cure for them; smoke from chaff is also helpful against fogs, in places where fogs do damage. some people advise burning three crabs alive among the trees to prevent the vines being injured by coal-blight, others roasting the flesh of a sheat-fish in a slow fire to windward, so that the smoke may spread all through the vineyard. varro gives the information that a vineyard suffers less damage from storms if, at the setting of the lyre, which marks the beginning of autumn, a picture of a bunch of grapes is placed among the vines as a votive offering. archibius in his letter to antiochus, king of syria, says that if a toad is buried in a new earthenware jar in the middle of a cornfield, the crop will not be damaged by storms.
