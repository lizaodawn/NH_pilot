the sumach has a similar leaf, but is smaller in size. it has the peculiarity of clothing its fruit (which is called pappus) with downy fluff, a thing that occurs with no other tree. the apharce also resembles the andrachle, and like it bears twice a year; they produce a first crop of fruit just at the time when the grapes are beginning to ripen, and a second at the beginning of winter. what sort of fruit is produced on these two occasions is not reported.
