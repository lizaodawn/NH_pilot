leaving these however, we come to the nation of the ingaevones, the first in germany; at which we begin to have some information upon which more implicit reliance can be placed. in their country is an immense mountain called sevo, not less than those of the riphaean range, and which forms an immense gulf along the shore as far as the promontory of the cimbri. this gulf, which has the name of the 'codanian,' is filled with islands; the most famous among which is scandinavia, of a magnitude as yet unascertained: the only portion of it at all known is inhabited by the nation of the hilleviones, who dwell in 500 villages, and call it a second world: it is generally supposed that the island of eningia is of not less magnitude. some writers state that these regions, as far as the river vistula, are inhabited by the sarmati, the venedi, the sciri, and the hirri, and that there is a gulf there known by the name of cylipenus, at the mouth of which is the island of latris, after which comes another gulf, that of lagnus, which borders on the cimbri. the cimbrian promontory, running out into the sea for a great distance, forms a peninsula which bears the name of cartris. passing this coast, there are three and twenty islands which have been made known by the roman arms: the most famous of which is burcana, called by our people fabaria, from the resemblance borne by a fruit which grows there spontaneously. there are those also called glaesaria by our soldiers, from their amber; but by the barbarians they are known as austeravia and actania.
