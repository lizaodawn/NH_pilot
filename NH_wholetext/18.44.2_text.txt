wind is injurious to wheat and barley at three seasons â€” when they are in flower or directly after they have shed their flower or when they are beginning to ripen; at the last stage it shrivels up the grain, while in the preceding eases its influence is to prohibit the seed from forming. successive gleams of sun appearing out of cloud are also injurious. also maggots breed in the root when after rains following seed-time a sudden spell of heat has enclosed the moisture in the ground. they also grow in the grain when heat following rain causes the ear to ferment. there is also a small beetle called the cantharis which gnaws away corn crops. when food fails, all these, creatures disappear. olive oil, pitch and grease are detrimental to seeds, and care must be taken not to let seed come in contact with them before it is sown. rain is beneficial to crops while in the stalk from the time of germination, but it damages wheat and barley when in blossom; although it does no harm to leguminous plants, excepting chick-pea. corn crops when beginning to ripen are damaged by rain, and particularly barley. also there is a white grass like italian millet that springs up all over the fields, and is also fatal to cattle. as for darnel, caltrops, thistle and burdock, i should not count these any more than brambles among diseases of cereals, but rather among pestilences of the soil itself. one of the most harmful climatic maladies of corn crops and vines is rust. this is most frequent in a district exposed to dew and in shut-in valleys that have no current of air through them, whereas windy places and high ground on the contrary are free from it. among the vices of corn is also overabundance, when the stalks fall down under the burden of fertility. but a vice common to all cultivated crops is caterpillars, which even attack chick-pea when rain makes it taste sweeter by washing away its saltness.
