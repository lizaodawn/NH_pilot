common wheat never ripens evenly, and yet no corn crop is less able to stand delay as, owing to its delicacy of structure, the ears that have ripened shed their grain at once. but it is less exposed to danger in the straw than other cereals, because it always has the ear on a straight stalk and it does not hold dew to cause rust. best emmer makes the sweetest bread; the grain itself is of closer fibre than ordinary emmer and the ear is at once larger and heavier: a peck of the grain seldom fails to make 16 pounds. in greece it is difficult to thresh and consequently homer speaks of it as being fed to cattle — for his word olyra means this grain; but on the other hand in egypt it is easy to thresh and gives a good yield. emmer has no beard, nor has common wheat, excepting the kind called laconian. with these are also to be classed bromos and tragos, entirely foreign grains, resembling rice imported from the east. tiphe itself also belongs to the same class — the grain from which a rice is produced in our part of the world. with the greeks there is also zea, and according to their account that grain and tiphe degenerate and go back to wheat, if they are sown after being ground, though not at once, but two years later.
