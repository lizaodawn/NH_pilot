there are various methods of actually getting in the harvest. on the vast estates in the provinces of gaul very large frames fitted with teeth at the edge and carried on two wheels are driven through the corn by a team of oxen pushing from behind; the ears thus torn off fall into the frame. elsewhere the stalks are cut through with a sickle and the ear is stripped off between two pitchforks. in some places the stalks are cut off at the root, in others they are plucked up with the root; and those who use the latter method explain that in the course of it they get the land broken, although really they are drawing the goodness out of it. there are also these differences: where they thatch the houses with straw, they keep it as long as possible, but where there is a shortage of hay, they require chaff for litter. straw of italian millet is not used for thatch; common millet stalks are usually burnt on the ground; barley stalks are kept as extremely acceptable to oxen. the gallic provinces gather both millets ear by ear, with a comb held in the hand.
