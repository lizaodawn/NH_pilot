labrusca too produces oenanthe, already sufficiently described by me; it is called by the greeks the wild vine, with thick whitish leaves, jointed stem and a bark covered with fissures. it bears grapes red like the scarlet berry, which clear the faces of women, removing blotches, while pounded and used with the leaves and juice they are good for sciatica and lumbago. a decoction of the root in water and drunk in two cyathi of coan wine evacuates watery humour in the belly, and for this reason is prescribed for dropsy. i am inclined to believe that it is rather this plant that is popularly called uva taminia. it is used as an amulet, and also for the spitting of blood; only however as a gargle, and, to prevent any of it from being swallowed, there are added salt, thyme and oxymel. for this reason it is thought unsafe to use it as a purge.
