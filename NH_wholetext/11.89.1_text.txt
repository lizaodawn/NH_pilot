between the sinews lie the arteries, which are the passages for the breath, and on these float the veins, which are the channels for the blood. the pulse of the arteries being particularly evident at the extremity of the limbs is usually a sign of diseases; with remarkable scientific skill it has been reduced by that high priest of medicine, herophilus, to definite rhythms and metrical rules throughout the periods of life - steady or hurried or slow. this sign has been neglected because of its excessive subtlety, but yet really it supplies a rule for the guidance of life by observation of the pulse-beat, rapid or languid. the arteries have no sensation, for they even are without blood, nor do they all contain the breath of life; and when they are cut only the part of the body concerned is paralysed. birds have not got either veins or arteries, nor yet have snakes, tortoises and lizards, and they have only a very small amount of blood.
