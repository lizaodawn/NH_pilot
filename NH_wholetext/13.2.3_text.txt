unguent of fenugreek is made of fresh olive-oil, cyprus, reed, melilot, fenugreek, honey, cat-thyme and scent of marjoram. this was much the most celebrated unguent in the time of menander, the author of comedies; but afterwards its place was taken by megalium, so called because of its celebrity as this was made of behen-nut oil, balsam, reed, rush, wood-balsam, casia and resin. a peculiarity of this unguent is that it must be constantly stirred while boiling until it ceases to have any odour, and when it becomes cold it recovers its scent.
