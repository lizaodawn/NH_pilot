looseness of the bowels is also checked by both kinds of ladanum; the one that grows in cornfields must be first crushed and passed through a sieve. it is taken in hydromel, or in wine of a good vintage. the name of ladon is given to a plant from which in cyprus is made the ladanum that clings to the beards of goats; a finer sort is prepared in arabia. today a kind is also found in syria and in africa, called toxicum. for they surround with pieces of wool strings fastened across a bow, and drag it over the plant; to this wool adhere the dew-like tufts of ladanum. i have said more about the plant in my section on unguents. this ladanum has a very strong smell and is very hard to the touch. in fact a great deal of earth sticks to it, while the most valued kind is clean, scented, soft, green and resinous. its nature is to soften, to dry, to mature abscesses, and to induce sleep. it prevents the hair from falling off, and preserves its dark colour. it is poured into the ears with hydromel or rose-oil. with the addition of salt it cures scurf on the skin and running sores, and chronic cough when taken with storax; it is also a very effective carminative.
