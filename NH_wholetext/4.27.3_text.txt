we must now leave the euxine to describe the outer portions of europe. after passing the riphaean mountains we have now to follow the shores of the northern ocean on the left, until we arrive at gades. in this direction a great number of islands are said to exist that have no name; among which there is one which lies opposite to scythia, mentioned under the name of raunonia, and said to be at a distance of the day's sail from the mainland; and upon which, according to timaeus, amber is thrown up by the waves in the spring season. as to the remaining parts of these shores, they are only known from reports of doubtful authority. with reference to the septentrional or northern ocean; hecataeus calls it, after we have passed the mouth of the river parapanisus, where it washes the scythian shores, the amalchian sea, the word 'amalchian' signifying in the language of these races, frozen. philemon again says that it is called morimarusa or the "dead sea" by the cimbri, as far as the promontory of rubeas, beyond which it has the name of the cronian sea. xenophon of lampsacus tells us that at a distance of three days' sail from the shores of scythia, there is an island of immense size called baltia, which by pytheas is called basilia. some islands called oonae are said to be here, the inhabitants of which live on the eggs of birds and oats; and others again upon which human beings are produced with the feet of horses, thence called hippopodes. some other islands are also mentioned as those of the panotii, the people of which have ears of such extraordinary size as to cover the rest of the body, which is otherwise left naked.
