when painters have dyed gold-solder, they call it orobitis, vetch-like, and distinguish two kinds, the purified which is kept for a cosmetic, and the liquid, in which the little balls are made into a paste with a liquid. both of these kinds are made in cyprus, but the most highly valued is in armenia and the second best in macedonia, while the greatest quantity is produced in spain, the highest recommendation in the latter being the quality of reproducing as closely as possible the colour in a bright green blade of corn. we have before now seen at the shows given by the emperor nero the sand of the circus sprinkled with gold-solder when the emperor in person was going to give an exhibition of chariot-driving wearing a coat of that colour. the unlearned multitude of artisans distinguish three varieties of the substance, the rough, which is valued at 7 denarii a pound, the middling, which is 5 denarii, and the crushed, also called the grass-green kind, 3 denarii. before applying the sandy variety they put on a preliminary coating of black dye and pure white chalk: these serve to hold the gold-solder and give a softness of colour. as the pure chalk is of a very unctuous consistency and extremely tenacious owing to its smoothness, it is sprinkled with a coat of black, to prevent the extreme whiteness of the chalk from imparting a pale hue to the gold-solder. the yellow gold-solder is thought to derive its name from the plant yellow-weed, which is itself often pounded up with steel-blue and applied for painting instead of' gold-solder, making a very inferior and counterfeit kind of colour.
