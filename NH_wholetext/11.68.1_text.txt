man and swine alone suffer from swollen throat, usually due to bad drinking water. the top part of the gullet is called the pharynx and the bottom part the stomach. this name denotes the cavity attached to the spine below the fleshy part of the windpipe, bulging out lengthwise and breadthwise like a flagon. species without a pharynx, for instance fishes, have no stomach either, and no neck nor throat, and the mouth is joined to the abdomen. the sea tortoise has not got a tongue or teeth, but breaks up all its food with the point of its snout. next comes the windpipe and the stomach, denticulated with ridges of thick skin like bramble-thorns for the purpose of grinding up the food, the interstices growing smaller in proportion as they are nearer to the abdomen: at the bottom it is as rough as a carpenter's rasp.
