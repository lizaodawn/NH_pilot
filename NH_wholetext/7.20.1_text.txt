varro in his account of cases of remarkable strength records that one tritanus, famous in the gladiatorial exercise with the samnite equipment, was slightly built but of exceptional strength, and that his son, a soldier of pompey the great, had a chequered crisscross of sinews all over his body, even in his arms and hands; and moreover that once he challenged one of the enemy to single combat, defeated him without a weapon in his hand, and finally took hold of him with a single finger and carried him off to the camp. vinnius valens served as captain in the imperial guard of the late lamented augustus; he was in the habit of holding carts laden with wine-sacks up in the air until they were emptied, and of catching hold of wagons with one hand and stopping them by throwing his weight against the efforts of the teams drawing them, and doing other marvellous exploits which can be seen carved on his monument. marcus varro likewise states: 'rusticelius, who was nicknamed hercules, used to lift his mule; fufius salvius used to walk up a ladder with two hundred pound weights fastened to his feet, the same weights in his hands and two two-hundred-pound weights on his shoulders.' we also saw a man named athanatus, who was capable of a miraculous display: he walked across the stage wearing a leaden breast-plate weighing 500 pounds and shod in boots of 500 pounds' weight. when the athlete milo took a firm stand, no one could make him shift his footing, and when he was holding an apple no one could make him straighten out a finger.
