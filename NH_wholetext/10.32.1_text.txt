geese and swans also migrate on a similar principle, but the flight of these is seen. they travel in a pointed formation like fast galleys, so cleaving the air more easily than if they drove at it with a straight front; while in the rear the flight stretches out in a gradually widening wedge, and presents a broad surface to the drive of a following breeze. they place their necks on the birds in front of them, and when the leaders are tired they receive them to the rear. (storks return to the same nest. they nourish their parents' old age in their turn.) a story is told about the mournful song of swans at their death - a false story as i judge on the strength of a certain number of experiences. swans are cannibals, and eat one another's flesh.
