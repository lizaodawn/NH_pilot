the testicles in sheep and oxen hang down against the legs, but in pigs they are closely knit to the body. in the dolphin they are very long, and stowed away in the lower part of the belly, and in the elephant also they are concealed. in oviparous creatures they are attached to the loins on the inside, these animals being very rapid in copulation. fishes and snakes have no testicles, but instead of them two passages from the kidneys to the genitals. buzzards have three. in man only they may be crushed owing to an injury or from natural causes, and this forms a third class, in distinction from hermaphrodites and eunuchs, the impotent. in every species except leopards and bears the mares are the stronger.
