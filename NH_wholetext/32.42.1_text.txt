they think that to eat fish causes bleeding, but that haemorrhage is stopped by crushing and applying the polypus, about which are current the following reports. it of itself gives out of itself brine, and therefore none should be added in cooking; it should be cut with a reed, for iron spoils it and leaves a taint, as the natures of the two quarrel. to stop bleeding they also apply the ash of frogs or their dried blood. some recommend the blood or ash to come from the frog called by the greeks calamites, because it lives among reeds and shrubs, the smallest and greenest of all frogs; some that the ash of frogs at their birth in water, while still tadpoles with a tail, and calcined in a new earthen vessel, should be stuffed into the nostrils of those with epistaxis. opposite is the use of leeches, called sanguisugae, which are employed to extract blood. for these are supposed to have the same purpose as that of cupping-glasses, to relieve the body of blood and to open the pores of the skin; but an objection is that once applied they create a craving for the same treatment every year at about the same time. many have been of opinion that leeches should be applied also for gout. when gorged leeches fall off, detached by the mere weight. of blood or by a sprinkle of salt; sometimes however they leave their heads stuck fast in the flesh, thus causing incurable wounds that have often proved fatal. an instance is messalinus, a patrician of consular rank, who applied leeches to his knee, and the remedy turned to a virulent poison. it is especially red leeches that are so dreaded; so they cut them off with scissors while they are sucking, and the blood runs down as it were through tubes; as they die their heads little by little contract, and are not left in the bite. the nature of leeches is adverse to that of bugs, which are killed if fumigated with leeches. beaver skins, burnt with liquid pitch and softened with leek juice, arrest discharges from the nostrils.
