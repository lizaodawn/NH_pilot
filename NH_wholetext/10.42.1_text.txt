there is another remarkable fact about songbirds; they usually change their colour and note with the season, and suddenly become different â€” which among the larger class of birds only cranes do, for these grow black in old age. the blackbird changes from black to red; and it sings in the summer, and chirps in winter, but at midsummer is silent; also the beak of yearling blackbirds, at all events the cocks, is turned to ivory colour. thrushes are of a speckled colour round the neck in summer but self-coloured in winter.
