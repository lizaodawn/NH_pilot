jet derives its name from a district and a river in lycia known as gages. it is said also to be washed up by the sea on the promontory of leucolla and to be gathered at places up to a distance of a mile and a half. jet is black, smooth, porous, light, not very different from wood, and brittle, and has an unpleasant smell when rubbed. anything inscribed in it on earthenware is indelible. when it is burnt it gives off a smell like that of sulphur. what is remarkable is that it is ignited by water and quenched by oil. the kindling of jet drives off snakes and relieves suffocation of the uterus. its fumes detect attempts to simulate a disabling illness or a state of virginity. moreover, when thoroughly boiled with wine it cures toothache and, if combined with wax, scrofulous tumours. the magi are said to make use of it in what they call divination by axes and they assert it will not burn away completely if a wish is destined to come true.
