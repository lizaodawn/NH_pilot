horned animals with teeth in one and those that have pastern-bones in the feet put on fat in the form of suet, but in those with cloven hooves or feet divided into toes, and without horns, it forms grease. this is of a solid substance and when it has cooled off can he broken up, and it is always where the flesh ends; whereas fat is between the flesh and the skin, and is moist and fluid. some animals, for instance the hare and the partridge, do not grow fat. all fat animals are more liable to barrenness, in the case of both males and females; also excessively fat ones get old more quickly. all animals have some fat in the eyes. in all cases the greasy fat has no sensation, because it does not possess arteries or veins; and in most animals also fatness of condition causes insensitiveness, and it is recorded that because of this pigs have been gnawed by mice while still alive. it is also on record that the son of the consular lucius apronius had his fat removed by an operation and relieved his body of unmanageable weight.
