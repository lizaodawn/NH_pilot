the best props for vine are those of which we have spoken, or else stakes from hard-oak and olive or if they are not available, props obtained from the juniper, cypress, laburnum or elder. staves of all other kinds must be cut back every year. for the cross-bar, reeds tied together in bundles are best for the growth of the vine, and they last five years. when shorter branches are tied together with brush-wood so as to make a sort of rope, the arcades made of them are called rope-trellises.
