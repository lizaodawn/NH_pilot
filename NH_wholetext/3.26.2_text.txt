at lissum begins the province of macedonia, the nations of the parthini, and behind them the dassaretae. the mountains of candavia are seventy-eight miles from dyrrhachium. on the coast lies denda, a town with the rights of roman citizens, the colony of epidamnum, which, on account of its inauspicious name, was by the romans called dyrrhachium, the river aous, by some called aeas, and apollonia, formerly a colony of the corinthians, at a distance of four miles from the sea, in the vicinity of which the celebrated nymphaion is inhabited by the barbarous amantes and buliones. upon the coast too is the town of oricum, founded by the colchians. at this spot begins epirus, with the acroceraunian mountains, by which we have previously mentioned this gulf of europe as bounded. oricum is distant from the sallentine promontory in italy eighty miles.
