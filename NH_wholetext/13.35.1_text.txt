shrubs growing in asia and greece are the epicactis, which others call emboline, with small leaves which taken in drink are an antidote against poisons, as those of the heath are against snakes, and the shrub that produces the grain of cnidus, which some call flax, the name of the shrub itself being thymelaea, which others call chamelaea, others pyros achne, some cnestor, others cneorum. it resembles the oleaster, but has narrower leaves, which when chewed have a gummy consistency; it is the size of a myrtle, and has a seed of the colour and shape of spelt, which is only used for medicinal purposes.
