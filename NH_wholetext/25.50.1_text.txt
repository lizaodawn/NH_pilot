animals too have discovered plants, and among the chief is the chelidonia. for by means of it swallows cure the eyes of the chicks in the nest, and restore the sight, as some hold, even when the eyes have been torn out. there are two kinds of it. the larger kind is bushy, and its leaf is like that of the wild carrot, but bigger, the plant itself being two cubits high, the colour light and the blossom yellow. the smaller has leaves like those of ivy, rounder and less pale. the juice is like saffron juice and pungent; the seed resembles that of the poppy. both plants blossom when the swallow arrives and wither when he departs. the juice is extracted while the plants are flowering, and is gently boiled down with attic honey in a copper vessel over hot ashes, being a sovereign remedy for dimness of vision. the juice is used both by itself and in the eye-salves called chelidonia after the plant.
