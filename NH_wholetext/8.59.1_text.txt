it is said that the viper is the only snake that hides in the ground, all the others using holes in trees or rocks. and for the rest they can last out a year's starvation if only they are protected against cold. all kinds sleep at the period of retirement and are not poisonous. snails also hibernate in the same way, these indeed retiring again in the summers also, mostly clinging to rocks, or even when violently bent back and torn away, nevertheless not going out. but those in the balearic islands called cave-snails do not crawl out of their holes in the ground and do not live on grass, but cling together in a cluster like a bunch of grapes. there is also another kind, which is not so common, that shuts itself in with a tightly fitting lid formed of the same material as its shell. these are always buried in the earth, and formerly were only dug up in the neighbourhood of the maritime alps, but they have now begun to be pulled up in the velitrae district also; however the most highly commended kind of all is on the island of astypalaea.
