the islands of the euxine: the islands of the euxine are the placate or cyaneae, otherwise called symplegades, and apollonia, surnamed thynias, to distinguish it from the island of that name in europe; it is four miles in circumference, and one mile distant from the mainland. opposite to pharnacea is chalceritis, to which the greeks have given the name of aria, and consecrated it to mars; here, they say, there were birds that used to attack strangers with blows of their wings.
