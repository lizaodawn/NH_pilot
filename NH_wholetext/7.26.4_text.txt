after having rescued the sea coast from pirates and restored to the roman people the command of the sea, he celebrated a triumph over asia, pontus, armenia, paphlagonia, cappadocia, cicilia, syria, the scythians, jews and albanians, iberia, the island of crete, the basternae, and, in addition to these, over king mithridates and tigranes. the crowning pinnacle of this glorious record was (as he himself declared in assembly when discoursing on his achievements) to have found asia the remotest of the provinces and then to have made her a central dominion of his country. if anybody on the other side desires to review in similar manner the achievements of caesar, who showed himself greater than pompey, he must assuredly roll off the entire world, and this it will be agreed is a task without limit.
