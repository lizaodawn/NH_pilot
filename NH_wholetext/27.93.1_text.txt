peplis, called by some syce, by others meconion or meconaphrodes, grows into a shrub from one slender root, and has leaves like those of rue but a little broader. under the leaves is a round seed, smaller than that of the white poppy. it is generally gathered among vines at harvest time, and is dried with its seed after a vessel has been placed beneath to catch this. taken in drink it relaxes the bowels, bringing away bile and phlegm. a moderate dose is an acetabulum in three heminae of hydromel. it is sprinkled over foods and relishes to loosen the bowels.
