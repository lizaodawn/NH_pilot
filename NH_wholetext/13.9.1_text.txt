palm-trees are of many varieties. the barren kinds are used in assyria and throughout the whole of palm. persia for building timber and for the more luxurious articles of manufacture. also there are forests of palms grown for timber which when felled send out shoots again from the root; the pith of these at the top, which is called their 'brain,' has a sweet taste, and after it has been removed the trees continue to live, which is not the case with other sorts of palm. the name of this tree is the chamaerops, and it has an exceptionally broad soft leaf which is extremely useful for wickerwork; it grows in large numbers in crete, but even more in sicily. palm-wood makes charcoal that lasts a long time and burns slowly. in the palms that bear fruit the core of the fruit is shorter in some cases than in others and also softer; in some cases it is of a bony substance, and when polished with the edge of a file is used by superstition as a charm against witchcraft. the core is wrapped in several coats which in some cases vary in number and in others in thickness. consequently there are forty-nine kinds of palm, if one cared to go through the names of them all, including those that have foreign names, and the varieties of wine that are extracted from them. the most famous of all is honoured by the name of the royal palm, because it used to be reserved for the kings of persia alone; it grew only at babylon in the garden of bagous - the persian word for a eunuch, some of these having actually been kings in persia. this garden was always kept within the precincts of the ruler's court.
