apios ischas or raphanos agria spreads out on the ground two or three rush-like stalks of a reddish colour with leaves like those of rue. the root is like that of an onion, but bigger, and this is the reason why some call it the wild radish. inside it has a white pap, outside, dark skins. it grows in rough, hilly spots, sometimes also in grass land. dug up in spring, it is pounded and immersed in an earthen vessel. after throwing away what floats on the surface they use the juice that remains as a purge and emetic, the dose being an obolus and a half in hydromel. prepared after this fashion a dose of an acetabulum is also given for dropsy. the dried root powdered is also sprinkled in a draught. they say that the upper part of it brings away the hues by vomiting, the lower part by stool.
