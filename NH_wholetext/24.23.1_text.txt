pitch too, its source and the methods of preparing it, i have already mentioned, as well as its two kinds, the thick and the thin. of the thick pitches the most useful in medicine is the bruttian, because being both very rich and very resinous it combines the useful properties of both, the yellow-red kind being of higher value than any other because of this combination. for the further opinion about pitch, that the male tree produces a better kind, cannot i think be entertained. the nature of pitch is to warm, and to fill out the flesh. mixed with pearl barley it is a specific antidote for the bite of the horned viper, and with honey a good remedy for quinsy, catarrhs and sneezing caused by phlegm. mixed with rose oil it is poured into the ears, and with wax it is compounded into an ointment. it heals lichen and relaxes the bowels; expectoration it eases if used as an electuary or applied to the tonsils in combination with honey. so used it also cleanses sores and fills them out. with raisins and axle-grease it cleanses carbuncles and festering sores; for creeping sores, however, it is combined with pine bark or sulphur. some authorities have prescribed it in doses of one cyathus for consumption and chronic cough. it cures chaps in the seat, and on the feet, superficial abscesses, scabrous nails, indurations and displacements of the uterus, and lethargus by inhalation. scrofulous sores it causes to suppurate if boiled with barley meal and the urine of a child not yet adolescent. dry pitch is also used for mange; bruttian pitch heated in wine, with wheat meal, is applied to the breasts of women, the applications being as hot as can be borne.
