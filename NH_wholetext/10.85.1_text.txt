the most prolific of all animals whatever is the mouse — one hesitates to state its fertility, even though on the authority of aristotle and the troops of alexander the great. it is stated that with it impregnation takes place by licking and not by coupling. there is a record of 120 being born from a single mother, and in persia of mice already pregnant being found in the parent's womb; and it is believed that they are made pregnant by tasting salt. accordingly it ceases to be surprising how so large an army of field-mice ravages the crops; and in the case of field-mice it is also hitherto unknown exactly how this vast multitude is suddenly destroyed: for they are never found dead, and nobody exists who ever dug up a mouse in a field in winter. vast numbers thus appear in the troad, and they have by now banished the inhabitants from that country. they appear during droughts. it is also related that when a mouse is going to die a worm grows in its head. the mice in egypt have hard hair like hedgehogs, and also they walk on two feet, as also do the alpine mice. — when animals of a different kind pair, the union is only fertile when the two species have the same period of gestation. there is a popular belief that of the oviparous quadrupeds the lizard bears through the mouth, but this is denied by aristotle. lizards do not hatch their eggs, but forget where they laid them, as this animal has no memory; and consequently the young ones break the shell without assistance.
