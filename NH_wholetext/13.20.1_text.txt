it is agreed that the egyptian thorn supplies the best kind of gum; it is of a streaked appearance, grey in colour, clean and free from bark, and it sticks to the teeth; its price is 3 denarii per pound. the gum produced from the bitter almond and the cherry is inferior, and that from plum-trees is the worst kind of all. a gum also forms in the vine which is extremely valuable for children's sores, and the gum sometimes found in the olive-tree is good for toothache; but the gun's also found in the elm on mount corycus in cilicia and in the juniper are of no use for anything, indeed elm-tree gum there even breeds gnats. also a gum exudes from the sarcocolla that is the name of the tree and also of the gum - which is extremely useful both to painters and to medical men; it resembles incense dust, and for the purposes mentioned the white kind is better than the red; its price is the one mentioned above.
