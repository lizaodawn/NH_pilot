wild thyme is thought to be so named from its being a creeping plant; this characteristic is to be found only in the wild kind, mostly in rocky districts; the cultivated does not creep, but grows up to be a palm in height. that growing spontaneously is a more luxuriant plant, with paler leaves and stalks, an efficacious antidote for serpent bites, particularly those of cenchris scolopendras, land or sea, and scorpions, the stalks and leaves being boiled in wine. when burnt it keeps away all such creatures by its smell, and is an especially potent antidote for the poison of marine creatures. for headache a decoction in vinegar is applied to the temples and forehead, rose oil being added; so also for phrenitis and lethargus. for griping and strangury, for quinsy and vomiting, four drachmae are taken in water. for liver complaints four oboli of the leaves are given, and the same in vinegar for splenic troubles. for spitting of blood it is pounded in two cyathi of oxymel.
