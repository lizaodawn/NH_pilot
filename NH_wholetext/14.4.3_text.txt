the next rank belongs to the vines of mentana, the wood of which is red, in consequence of which some people have called them the 'ruddy vines.' these produce less wine, as they have too much husk and lees, but they are very strong in resisting frost, and they suffer worse from drought than rain and from heat than cold, and consequently they hold the first place in cold and damp localities. the variety with a smaller berry is more productive, and the one with a cleft leafless.
