of weasels there are two kinds, one wild and larger than the other, called by the greeks ictis. the gall of both is said to be efficacious against asps, though otherwise poisonous. the other kind, however, which strays about our homes, and moves daily, as cicero tells us, its nest and kittens, chases away snakes. its flesh, preserved in salt and given in doses of one denarius by weight, is given in three cyathi of drink to those who have been bitten, or its stomach stuffed with coriander seed is kept to dry and taken in wine. a kitten of the weasel is even better still for this purpose.
