the first of all forms of disease in wheat is the oat. barley also degenerates into oats, in such a way that the oat itself counts as a kind of corn, inasmuch as the races of germany grow crops of it and live entirely on oatmeal porridge. the degeneration in question is principally due to dampness of soil and climate, but a subsidiary cause is contained in weakness of the seed, if it is held back too long in the ground before it shoots out. there is also the same explanation if it was rotten when it was sown. but it is recognizable the moment it breaks out of the ground, which shows that the cause is contained in the root. there is also another disease arising in close connection with oats, when after the grain has begun to fill out but its growth is not yet mature, before it makes a strong body it becomes hollow and empty owing to some noxious blast and fades away in the ear by a sort of abortion.
