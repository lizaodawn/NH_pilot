not less important or very different is the use made of alum, by which is meant a salt exudation from the earth. there are several varieties of it. in cyprus there is a white alum and another sort of a darker colour, though the difference of colour is only slight; nevertheless the use made of them is very different, as the white and liquid kind is most useful for dying woollens a bright colour whereas the black kind is best for dark or sombre hues. black alum is also used in cleaning gold. all alum is produced from water and slime, that is, a substance exuded by the earth; this collects naturally in a hollow in winter and its maturity by crystallisation is completed by the sunshine of summer; the part of it that separates earliest is whiter in colour. it occurs in spain, egypt, armenia, macedonia, pontus, africa, and the islands sardinia, melos, lipari and stromboli; the most highly valued is in egypt and the next best in melos. the alum of melos also is of two kinds, fluid and dense. the test of the fluid kind is that it should be of a limpid, milky consistency, free from grit when rubbed between the fingers, and giving a slight glow of colour; this kind is called in greek 'phorimon' in the sense of 'abundant.' its adulteration can be detected by means of the juice of a pomegranate, as this mixed with it does not turn it black if it is pure. the other kind is the pale rough alum which may be stained with oak-gall also, and consequently this is called 'paraphoron,' perverted or adulterated alum. liquid alum has an astringent, hardening and corrosive property. mixed with honey it cures ulcers in the mouth, pimples and eruptions; this treatment is carried out in baths containing two parts of honey to one of alum. it reduces odour from the armpits and perspiration. it is taken in pills against disorders of the spleen and discharge of blood in the urine. mixed with soda and chamomile it is also a remedy for scabies.
