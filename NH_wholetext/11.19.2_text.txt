nature has given bees a sting attached to the stomach, designed for a single blow; certain persons think that when they have planted their sting they at once die, while some hold that this only occurs if it is driven in so far that some of the gut follows it, but that afterwards the bees are drones and do not make honey, as though their strength had been castrated, and they cease at the same time both to hurt and to benefit. there is a case of a horse being killed by bees. bees hate foul smells and flee far away from them, even those not due to natural causes; consequently they attack people scented with perfumes. they themselves are liable to injuries from very many creatures. wasps and hornets which are degenerate species of the same nature attack them, as also do the species of gnat called mule-flies. swallows and some other birds ravage them. frogs lie in wait for them when they are getting water, which is their most important task at the period when they are producing offspring. and not only the frogs that beset ponds and rivers but also toads come of their own accord and crawling up to the doorways blow through them; thereupon the guard flies out and is immediately snapped up; and it is said that frogs do not feel a bee's sting. sheep too are the enemies of bees, which with difficulty disentangle themselves from their wool. also the smell of crabs being boiled near them is fatal to them.
