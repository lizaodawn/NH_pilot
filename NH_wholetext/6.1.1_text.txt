the euxine and the maryandini: the euxine sea, which in former times had the name of axenus, from the savage and inhospitable character of the nations living on its borders, by a peculiar whim of nature, which is continually giving way before the greedy inroads of the sea, lies between europe and asia. it was not enough for the ocean to have surrounded the earth, and then deprived us of a considerable portion of it, thus rendering still greater its uninhabitable proportion; it was not enough for it to have forced a passage through the mountains, to have torn away calpe from africa, and to have swallowed up a much larger space than it left untouched; it was not enough for it to have poured its tide into the propontis through the hellespont, after swallowing up still more of the dry land â€” for beyond the bosporus, as well, it opens with its insatiate appetite upon another space of immense extent, until the maeotian lakes unite their ravening waters with it as it ranges far and wide.
