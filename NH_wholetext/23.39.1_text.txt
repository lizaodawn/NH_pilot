of the nature and usefulness of olive oil i have already spoken at length. here are the kinds that contribute to medicine: the most useful is omphacium, next comes green oil; moreover, it should be as fresh as possible (unless there is special need for the oldest oil), thin, with a pleasant odour and no pungent taste â€” in fact the reverse of what we look for when it is used in food. omphacium is good for the gums. if it be retained in the mouth it keeps the teeth white and strengthens loose ones. it checks perspirations.
