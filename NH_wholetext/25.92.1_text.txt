some call the anagallis, acoron. there are two kinds of it: the male with a scarlet flower, and the female with a blue one; neither is more than a span in height, the stem being tender, and the leaves tiny, round and lying on the ground. they grow in gardens and on moist ground. the blue-flowered kind blossoms first. the juice of either kind, applied with honey, disperses film on the eyes, suffusions of blood from a blow, and reddish argema; the results are better if the ointment is made with attic honey. it dilates the pupils, and so these are smeared with it before perforation for cataract. these plants also cure eye diseases in draught animals. the juice also clears the head if poured through the nostrils, but it must be rinsed out afterwards with wine. a drachma dose of the juice is also taken in wine for snake bites. it is a wonderful thing that cattle avoid the female plant, or if deceived by the resemblance — for the only difference is in the flower — they have partaken of it, they at once seek as a remedy the plant called asyla. we romans call it 'cat's-eye'. some instruct the diggers to say nothing until they have saluted it before sunrise, and then to gather it and extract the juice, for so they say its efficacy is at its greatest. about the juice of euphorbea enough has been said. ophthalmia, if there is swelling, will be benefited by wormwood beaten up with honey, and also by powdered betony.
