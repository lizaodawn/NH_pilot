some judge the wholesomeness of water by means of the balance. this is wasted carefulness, for it is very rare for one water to be lighter than another. a more reliable and a delicate test is that, other things being equal, a water is better that becomes warm and cool more quickly. moreover we are told that if drawn in vessels [without being weighed, or without being warmed by the hand] and placed on the ground, the better water becomes warm. from what source then shall we obtain the most commendable water? from wells surely, as i see they are generally used in towns, but they should be those the water of which by frequent withdrawals is kept in constant motion, and those where due thinness is obtained by filtering through the earth. for wholesomeness so much suffices; for coolness both shade is necessary and that the well should be open to the air. one point above all must be observed — and this is also important for a continuous flow — well water should issue from the bottom, not the sides. but coolness to the touch can also be obtained artificially, if the water is forced aloft or let fall from a height, beating and absorbing the air. in swimming indeed the same water is felt to be cooler by those who hold their breath. it was a discovery of the emperor nero to boil water and cool it in a glass vessel by thrusting it into snow. in this way is obtained a pleasant coolness without the injurious qualities of snow. at any rate it is agreed that all water is more serviceable when boiled, and that water which has been heated can be cooled to a greater degree — a most clever discovery. it purifies bad water to boil it down to one half. cold water taken internally checks bleeding, and to hold it in the mouth prevents overheating in the bath. water that is very cold to swallow is not always so to the touch; this good quality alternates as many find out by personal experience.
