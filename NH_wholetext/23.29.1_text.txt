the ancients, as dieuches tells us, prepared oxymel in the following manner. ten minae of honey, five heminae of old vinegar, a pound and a quarter by weight of sea salt and five sextarii of water, were boiled together in a cauldron, but taken off the boil ten times, when it was poured off and put away to keep. asclepiades condemned it, and did away with its use altogether - for it used to be given even in fevers - yet he admits that it was beneficial for the bites of the serpent called seps, and for poisoning by opium or mistletoe. it made a warm gargle for quinsy, with benefit to the ears also and to the mouth and throat when affected. for all these purposes they now spray, getting better results, with oxyalme, that is, with salt and fresh vinegar.
