caelius states that the length of the alps from the upper sea to the lower is 1000 miles, a distance which timagenes shortens by twenty-two. cornelius nepos assigns to them a breadth of 100 miles, and t. livius of 3000 stadia; but then in different places. for in some localities they exceed 100 miles; where they divide germany, for instance, from italy; while in other parts they do not reach seventy, being thus narrowed by the providential dispensation of nature as it were. the breadth of italy, taken from the river var at the foot of these mountains, and passing along by the vada sabatia, the taurini, comum, brixia, verona, vicetia, opitergium, aquileia, tergeste, pola, and arsia, is 745 miles.
