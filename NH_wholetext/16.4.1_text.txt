in olden times indeed no civic wreath was presented save to a deity — that is why homer assigns a wreath only to heaven and to a whole battlefield, but to no man individually even in combat — and it is said that father liber was the first to set a crown on his own head, a wreath of ivy. afterwards persons performing sacrifices in honour of the gods assumed crowns, the victims being adorned with wreaths as well. most recently of all they were also brought into use in ritual competitions, but in these and at the present day they are not bestowed on the winner, but an announcement is made that by him a wreath is conferred upon his native place; and from this has arisen the custom of also bestowing wreaths on victorious generals about to go in a triumphal procession, for them to dedicate as offerings in the temples, and also subsequently the practice of presenting wreaths at the games. to discuss who was the first roman to receive each kind of wreath would be a lengthy matter, and not relevant to the plan of this work, and as a matter of fact the romans were only acquainted with those given for military achievements; but it is a well-known fact that this one nation has a greater variety of wreaths than all the other nations put together.
