these stones, then, can be cut with a saw. however, the specular stone (for even this substance ranks as a stone) has a far more amenable character which allows it to be split into plates as thin as may be wished. formerly it was produced only in hither spain, and even then not in the whole of the province, but merely within an area of a hundred miles around the city of priego. nowadays supplies come too from cyprus, cappadocia, sicily and, a recent discovery, from africa. however, all these kinds are inferior to that of spain: cappadocia produces the largest pieces, but they lack transparency. moreover, in the region of bononia in italy small streaks occur tightly embedded within hard rock; and yet they are large enough for their essential similarity to the rest to be unmistakable. in spain the specular stone is dug at a great depth by means of shafts; and it is found too just beneath the surface enclosed in rock, in which case it has to be torn away or cut out; but for the most part its formation allows it to be dug, since it occurs in isolation as rough blocks. no piece exceeding five feet in length has hitherto been discovered. it is palpably obvious that we have here a liquid which, like rock-crystal, has been frozen and petrified by an exhalation in the earth, because when wild animals fall down the shafts just mentioned the marrow in their bones after a single winter takes on the appearance of this selfsame stone. on occasion a black variety of the stone is also found, but it is the bright kind, notoriously soft though it may be, that has a remarkable property of withstanding the effects of hot and cold weather. moreover, provided that it escapes abuse, it does not deteriorate, although this is apt to happen even with blocks of many varieties of stone. a further use has been devised for the specular stone in the shape of the shavings and flakes strewn on the surface of the circus maximus during the games to produce an attractively bright effect.
