in some places, the earth trembles when trodden on â€” for instance in the gabii district not from the city of rome about 200 acres shake when horsemen gallop over them, and similarly in the reate district. certain islands are always afloat, as in the districts of caecubum and of reate mentioned above and modena and statonium, and in lake vadimon, the dense wood near the springs of cutilia which is never to be seen in the same place by day and by night, the islands in lydia named the reed islands which are not only driven by the winds, but can be punted in any direction at pleasure with poles, and so served to rescue a number of the citizens in the mithridatic war. there are also small islands at nymphaion called the dancing islands, because they move to the foot-beats of persons keeping time with the chanting of a choral song. on the great lake of tarquinium in italy two islands float about carrying woods, their outline as the winds drive them forward now forming the shape of a triangle and now of a circle, but never a square.
