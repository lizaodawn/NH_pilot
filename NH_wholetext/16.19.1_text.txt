the fifth kind of resinous tree has the same habitat and the same appearance; it is called the larch. its timber is far superior, not rotting with age and offering a stubborn resistance to damp; also it has a reddish colour and a rather penetrating scent. resin flows from this tree in rather large quantities, of the colour and stickiness of honey, and never becoming hard.
