cato says: 'you can make manure of stable-litter, lupines, chaff, beanstalks and holm-oak or oak leaves. pull up the dane-wort and hemlock out of the crop, and the high grass and sedge growing round osier beds; use this as litter for sheep, and rotten leaves for oxen.' - 'if a vine is making poor growth, make a bonfire of its shoots and plough in the ashes therefrom.' he also says: 'where you are going to sow corn, give your sheep a free run on the land.'
