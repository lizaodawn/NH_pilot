the greeks build house-walls, as though they were using brick, of hard stone or silex dressed to a uniform thickness. when they follow this procedure the style of masonry is what they call 'isodomos,' or 'masonry with equal courses.' when the courses laid are of varying thickness the style is known as 'pseudisodomos' a spurious variety of the former. a third style is the 'emplectos' or 'interwoven,' in which only the faces are dressed, the rest of the material being laid at random. it is essential that joints should be made to alternate in such a way that the middle of a stone covers the vertical joint in the course last laid. this should be done even in the core of the wall if circumstances permit, and failing this, at least on the faces. when the core of the wall is packed with rubble, the style is 'diatonieos,' 'with single stones stretching from face to face.' 'network masonry,' which is very commonly used in buildings at rome, is liable to crack. all masonry should be laid to rule and level, and should be absolutely perpendicular when tested with a plummet.
