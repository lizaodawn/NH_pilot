to come now to the classes of water: some waters are good for sinews or feet, or for sciatica; others for dislocations or fractures; they purge the bowels; heal wounds; are specific for head, or for ears; while the ciceronian are so for the eyes. it is worth while recording that there is a country seat on the coast as you go from lake avernus to puteoli, with a famous portico and grove, which lvi. cicero, copying athens, called academia. there he wrote the volumes called academica, and in it he also erected memorials to himself, as though indeed he had not done so throughout the whole world. in the front part of this estate, when the owner was antistius vetus, a short time after cicero's demise there burst out hot springs, very beneficial for eye complaints, which have been made famous by a poem of laurea tullus, who was one of cicero's freedmen. from it we at once realize that even his servants drew inspiration from that mighty genius. for i will quote the actual poem, which deserves to be read, not only on this site, but everywhere.
