and starch is made from, every kind of wheat and common wheat, but the best from three-month wheat. for its discovery we are indebted to the island of chios, and that is where the best kind comes from today. its name is greek, and means 'made without milling'. next to the starch made from three-month wheat is the kind made of the lightest sort of wheat. this is soaked with fresh water in wooden tubs, with the grain completely covered, the water being changed five times in the course of a day, and preferably in the night time as well, so as to get it mixed up evenly with the grain. when it is quite soft but before it goes sour it is strained through linen or wicker baskets and poured out on a tiled surface that has been smeared with leaven, and left to thicken in the sun. next to the starch of chios that from crete is most highly spoken of; and then comes the egyptian kind. the test of its quality is smooth consistency and light weight, and the condition of being flesh. it has moreover been mentioned already by cato among ourselves.
