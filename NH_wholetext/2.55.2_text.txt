in making these observations the tuscans divided the heaven into sixteen parts: the first quarter is from the north to the equinoctial sunrise (east), the second to the south, the third to the equinoctial sunset (west), and the fourth occupies the remaining space extending from west to north; these quarters they subdivided into four parts each, of which they called the eight starting from the east the left-hand regions and the eight opposite ones the right-hand. of these the most formidable are those lying between west and north. hence the line of approach and the line of retirement of thunderbolts is of very great importance. it is best for them to return to parts in the region of sunrise. accordingly it will be a portent of supreme happiness when they come from the first part of the sky and retire to the same part - a sign that history records to have been vouchsafed to the dictator sulla; but all the others are less fortunate or actually direful, in accordance with the division of the actual firmament where they occur. some people think it wrong to give or to listen to reports of thunderbolts, except if they are told to a guest or a parent.
