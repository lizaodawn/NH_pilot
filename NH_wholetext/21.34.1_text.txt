southernwood, which blossoms in summer has a flower of a pleasant but heavy scent and of a golden colour. left alone it grows of its own accord, reproducing itself by layers from the head. it is however grown from seed better than from the root or from slips; from seed too not without trouble. the seedlings are transplanted - as is the adonium - both in summer. for they are very chilly plants, yet liable to be injured by too much sun. but when they have grown strong, they sprout after the manner of rue. like southernwood in scent is leucanthemum, with a white flower and abundant leaves.
