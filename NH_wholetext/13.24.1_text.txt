there is a great difference in the breadth of the various kinds of paper: the best is thirteen inches wide, the hieratic two inches less, the fannian measures ten inches and the amphitheatre paper one less, while the saitic is still fewer inches across and is not as wide as the mallet used in making it, as the emporitic kind is so narrow that it does not exceed six inches. other points looked at in paper are fineness, stoutness, whiteness and smoothness. the status of best quality was altered by the emperor claudius. the reason was that the thin paper of the period of augustus was not strong enough to stand the friction of the pen, and moreover as it let the writing show through there was a fear of a smudge being caused by what was written on the back, and the great transparency of the paper had an unattractive look in other respects. consequently the foundation was made of leaves of second quality and the woof or cross layer of leaves of the first quality. claudius also increased the width of the sheet, making it a foot across. there were also eighteen-inch sheets called 'maerocola,' but examination detected a defect in them, as tearing off a single strip damaged several pages. on this account claudius paper has come to be preferred to all other kinds, although the augustus kind still holds the field for correspondence; but livia paper, having no quality of a first-class kind, but being entirely second class, has retained its position.
