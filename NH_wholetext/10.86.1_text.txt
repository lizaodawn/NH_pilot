we have it from many authorities that a snake may be born from the spinal marrow of a human being. for a number of animals spring from some hidden and secret source, even in the quadruped class, for instance salamanders, a creature shaped like a lizard, covered with spots, never appearing except in great rains and disappearing in fine weather. it is so chilly that it puts out fire by its contact, in the same way as ice does. it vomits from its mouth a milky slaver, one touch of which on any part of the human body causes all the hair to drop off, and the portion touched changes its colour and breaks out in a tetter.
