their period of gestation is commonly supposed to be ten years, but aristotle puts it at two years, and says that they never bear more than one at a time, and that they live 200 and in some cases 300 years. their adult life begins at 60. they take the greatest pleasure in rivers and roam in the neighbourhood of streams, although at the same time they are unable to swim because of the size of their bodies, and also as they are incapable of enduring cold: this is their greatest infirmity; they are also liable to flatulence and diarrhoea, but not to other kinds of disease. i find it stated that missiles sticking in their body fall out when they drink oil, but that perspiration makes it easier for them to keep their hold. it also causes them disease to eat earth unless they chew it repeatedly; but they devour even stones, consider trunks of trees a great delicacy, and bend down the loftier palm trees by butting against them with their foreheads and when thus prostrate consume their fruit. they eat with the mouth, but they breathe and drink and smell with the organ not unsuitably called their hand. they hate the mouse worst of living creatures, and if they see one merely touch the fodder placed in their stall they refuse it with disgust. they are liable to extreme torture if in drinking they swallow a leech (the common name for which i notice has now begun to be 'blood-sucker'); when this attaches itself in the actual breathing passage it causes intolerable pain.
