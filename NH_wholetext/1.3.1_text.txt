but if lucilius, the originator of critical sniffing, thought fit to say this, and cicero to quote it, especially when writing his theory of the constitution, how much more reason have we to stand on the defensive against a particular juryman? but for my part at the present i have deprived myself of these defences by my nomination, as it matters a great deal whether one obtains a judge by lot or by one's own selection, and one's style of entertainment ranks quite differently with a guest one has invited and one who has offered himself. the candidates in a hotly contested election deposited sums of money with cato, that resolute foe of corruption, who enjoyed a defeat at the polls as an honour obtained free of charge; and they gave out that they did this in the defence of the highest among human possessions, their innocence. this was the occasion of that famous sigh of cicero — 'o happy marcus porcius whom no one dares to ask for something underhand!' lucius scipio asiaticus by appealing to the tribunes, one of them being gracchus, testified that his case could be made good even to an unfriendly judge: in fact a judge whom one chooses oneself one makes the supreme arbiter of one's case — this is the source of the term 'appeal.' you yourself indeed, i know, being placed on the loftiest pinnacle of all mankind, and being endowed with supreme eloquence and learning, are approached with reverential awe even by persons paying a visit of ceremony, and consequently care is taken that what is dedicated to you may be worthy of you. however, country folk, and many natives, not having incense, make offerings of milk and salted meal, and no man was ever charged with irregularity for worshipping the gods in whatever manner was within his power.
