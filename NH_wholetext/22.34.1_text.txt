there are two kinds of acanthus, a plant of the ornamental garden and of the city, which has a broad, long leaf, and covers the banks of borders and the flat tops of the raised portions of gardens. one is thorny and curled, which is the shorter; the other is smooth, and is called by some paederos, by others melamphyllum. its roots are wonderfully good for burns, sprains, ruptures, convulsions, and those threatened with consumption; for which reason they are boiled for food, mostly in barley water. for gouty limbs too they are applied, pounded and hot.
