when the euphrates ceases, by running in its channel, to afford protections to those who dwell on its banks, which it does when it approaches the confines of charax, the country is immediately infested by the attali, a predatory people of arabia, beyond whom are found the scenite. the banks along this river are occupied by the nomades of arabia, as far as the deserts of syria, from which, as we have already stated, it takes a turn to the south, and leaves the solitary deserts of palmyra. seleucia is distant, by way of the euphrates, from the beginning of mesopotamia, eleven hundred and twenty-five; from the red sea, by way of the tigris, two hundred and twenty; and from zeugma, seven hundred and twenty-three, miles. zeugma is distant from seleucia in syria, on the shores of our sea, one hundred and seventy-five miles. such is the extent of the land that lies in these parts between the two seas. the length of the kingdom of parthia is nine hundred and eighteen miles.
