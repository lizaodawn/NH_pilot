wild astaphis, otherwise staphis, wrongly called by some uva taminia - for that is a distinct plant - with dark, straight stalks and the leaves of the wild vine, bears what may be called more correctly pods rather than grapes, green and like chickpeas, with a three-cornered stone in them. it ripens at harvest time and grows dark, whereas we are familiar with the red grapes of the taminian vine, and also know that staphis grows on sunny sites, while the taminian vine is found only on shady spots. i should not recommend the use of these stones as a purge owing to the danger of choking, nor yet to dry phlegm in the mouth, because it is injurious to the throat. pounded they rid the head of lice, as well as the rest of the body, and the more readily if sandarach be mixed with them, and also cure pruritus and itch scab. a decoction in vinegar is made for toothache, for affections of the ears, for fluxes from scars and for running ulcers. the pounded flowers are taken in wine to counteract the poison of serpents; the seed however i should reject because of its excessive heat. some call the plant pituitaria. serpent bites in particular are treated by applications of it.
