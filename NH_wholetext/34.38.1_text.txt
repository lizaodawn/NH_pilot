we will not omit one further remarkable thing about copper. the servilian family, famous in our annals, possesses a bronze as piece which it feeds with gold and silver and which consumes them both. its origin and nature are unknown to me, but i will put down the actual words of the elder messala on the subject. the family of the servilii has a holy coin to which every year they perform sacrifices with the greatest devotion and splendour; and they say that this coin seems to have on some occasions grown bigger and on other occasions smaller, and that thereby it portends either the advancement or the decadence of the family.
