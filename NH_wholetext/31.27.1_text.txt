signs of the presence of water are rushes, the plant about which i have spoken, and frogs squatting on their chest in great numbers for any one place. for wild willow, alder, vitex, reed, or ivy, which grow spontaneously and where there is a settling of rainwater flowing from higher regions to one lower down, are deceptive indications; one much more reliable is a misty steam, visible from a distance before sunrise, for which some water-finders watch from a height, lying prone with their chin touching the earth. there is also a special sign, known only to experts, which they look for in the hottest season and in the most blazing heat of the day, the nature of the reflection that shines from each locality. for if one spot looks moister while the earth around is parching, that is an infallible sign. but so great is the necessary strain on the eyes that pain results. to avoid this strain they have recourse to other tests. they dig a hole to the depth of five feet, covering it with jars of unbaked potters' clay, or else with a well-oiled bronze basin, and also a burning lamp arched over with foliage and earth on top; if the clay is found to be wet or broken, or if moisture covers the bronze, or the lamp goes out without any failure of oil, or perchance a flock of wool is wet, then the finding of water is assured. some also light a fire first and dry the hole, making yet more conclusive the evidence of the vessels.
