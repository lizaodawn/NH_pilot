an almost innumerable multitude of artists have been rendered famous by statues and figures of smaller size; but before them all stands the athenian pheidias, celebrated for the statue of olympian zeus, which in fact was made of ivory and gold, although he also made figures of bronze. he flourished in the 83rd olympiad [448 bce], about the 300th year of our city, at which same period his rivals were alcamenes, critias, nesiotes and hegias; and later, in the 87th olympiad [432 bce] there were hagelades, callon and the spartan gorgias, and again in the 90th olympiad [420 bce] polycleitus, phradmon, myron, pythagoras, scopas and perellus. of these polycleitus had as pupils argius, asopodorus, alexis, aristides, phryno, dino, athenodorus, and demeas of clitor; and myron had lycius. in the 95th olympiad [400 bce] flourished naucydes, dinomenes, canachus and patroclus; and in the 102nd [372 bce] polycles, cephisodotus, leochares and hypatodorus; in the 104th [364 bce] praxiteles and euphranor; in the 107th [352 bce] aetion and therimachus. lysippus was in the 113th [328 bce], the period of alexander the great, and likewise his brother lysistratus, sthennis, euphron, sophocles, sostratus, ion and silanion - a remarkable fact in the case of the last named being that he became famous without having had any teacher; he himself had zeuxiades as his pupil - and in the 121st [296 bce] eutychides, euthycrates, laippus, cephisodotus, timarchus and pyromachus. after that the art languished, and it revived again in the 156th olympiad [156 bce], when there were the following, far inferior it is true to those mentioned above, but nevertheless artists of repute: antaeus, callistratus, polycles of athens, callixenus, pythocles, pythias and timocles.
