a similar animal is the scincos - and indeed it has been styled the land crocodile - but it is paler, and with a thinner skin. the chief difference, however, between it and the crocodile is in the arrangement of the scales, which are turned from the tail towards the head. the indian is the biggest scincos, next coming the arabian. they import them salted. its muzzle and feet, taken in white wine, are aphrodisiac, especially with the addition of satyrion and rocket seed, a single drachma of all three and two drachmae of pepper being compounded. one-drachma lozenges of the compound should be taken in drink. two oboli of the flesh of the flanks by itself, taken in drink with myrrh and pepper in similar proportions, are believed to be more efficacious for the same purpose. it is also good for the poison of arrows, as apelles informs us, if taken before and after the wound. it is also an ingredient of the more celebrated antidotes. sextius says that more than a drachma by weight, taken in a hemina of wine, is a fatal dose, and that moreover the broth of a scincos taken with honey is antaphrodisiac.
