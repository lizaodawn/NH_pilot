four kinds of daucus were distinguished by petronius diodotus. there is no point in giving the details of these, as there are but two species. the most highly valued grows in crete, the next in achaia and everywhere in dry districts; it resembles fennel, but has paler, smaller and hairy leaves, a straight stem a foot high, and a root with a very pleasant taste and smell. this kind grows on rocky soils that face the south. the other kinds grow everywhere on earthy hills and cross-paths, but only if the soil is rich; they have leaves like those of coriander, a stem a cubit high, round heads, often more than three, and a wood-like root, which when dry is worthless. its seed is like that of cummin, while that of the first kind is like millet, white, sharp, and scented and hot in all kinds. the seed of the second kind is more powerful than that of the first, and for this reason should be used sparingly. if one really desires to add a third kind, there is one like staphylinus, called wild carrot, with longish seed and a sweet root. a quadruped, summer and winter, refuses to touch any of these plants except after miscarriage. of the cretan kind the root is used, chiefly for snake bites, of the other kinds the seed. the dose is one drachma taken in wine; it is given also to quadrupeds that have been bitten.
