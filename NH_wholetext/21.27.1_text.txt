having now nearly exhausted the subject also of the most popular colours, i ought to pass on to those chaplets that please only because of the variety in their make-up. they are of two kinds: some are made of flowers, others of leaves. among the flowers i would include greenweed — for the yellow blossom of this too is gathered — also the oleander, and the jujubes of the kind called cappadocian, having a scent like that of olive flowers. among brambles grows the cyclamen, about which i shall say more elsewhere. its flower, colossae purple in colour, is used to make up chaplets.
