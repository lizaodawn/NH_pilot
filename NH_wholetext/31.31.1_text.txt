for the rest, the best way for water to be brought from a spring is in earthenware pipes two fingers thick, the joints boxed together so that the upper pipe fits into the lower, and smoothed with quicklime and oil. the gradient of the water should be at least a quarter of an inch every hundred feet; should it come in a tunnel, there must be vent holes every two actus. when water is required to form a jet, it should come in lead pipes. water rises as high as its source. if it comes from a long distance, the pipe should frequently go up and down, so that no momentum may be lost. the usual length for a piece of piping is ten feet; five-finger lengths should weigh 60 pounds, eight-finger lengths 100 pounds, ten-finger lengths 120 pounds, and so on in proportion. a ten-finger pipe is so called when the breadth of the strip before bending is ten fingers, and one half as large a five-finger pipe. at every bend of a hill where the momentum must be controlled, it is necessary to use a five-finger pipe; reservoirs must be made according as circumstances require.
