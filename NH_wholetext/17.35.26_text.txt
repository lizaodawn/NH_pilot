plan has recently been invented of planting a snake-branch near the tree — that is our name for a veteran main branch that has grown hard with many years' service. the quickest plan in the case of a vine is to cut this old branch off as long as possible and scrape the bark off three-quarters of its length, down to the point to which it is to be buried in the ground — for this reason it is also called a scraped shoot — and then to press it down in the furrow, with the remaining part standing straight up against the tree. if the vine be meagre or the soil thin, it is customary to cut down the plant as close to the round as possible, until the root gets strong, and likewise not to plant it when there is dew on it, nor in a place exposed to a north wind; the vines themselves ought to face north-east, but their young shoots should have a southerly aspect.
