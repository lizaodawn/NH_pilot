the three planets whose positions we have stated to be above the sun travel with the sun when they set and are never more than 11 degrees separate from the sun at dawn when they rise. afterwards they retire from contact with his rays, and make their morning or 'first' stations in a triangle 120 degrees away, and subsequently their evening risings opposite 180 degrees away, and again approaching from the other side, make their evening or 'second' stations 120 degrees away, till the sun overtaking them at 12 degrees obscures them â€” this is called their evening setting. the planet mars being nearer feels the sun's rays even from its quadrature, at an angle of 90 degrees, which has given to his motion after each rising the name of 'first' or 'second ninety-degree.' at the same time mars remains stationary in the signs of the zodiac for periods of six months (otherwise having a two-month period), whereas jupiter and saturn spend less than four months in each station. the two lower planets (mercury and venus) are similarly obscured at their evening conjunction, and when left by the sun make their morning rising the same number of degrees away, and from the further limits of their distance follow the sun and when they have overtaken him are hidden in their morning setting and pass away. then they rise in the evening at the same distance apart, as far as the limits we have stated. from these they pass backward to the sun, and disappear in their evening setting. the planet venus actually makes two stations, morning and evening, after each rise, from the furthest limits of her distance. mercury's stations have too short a period to be perceptible.
