there is a weed that kills off chick-pea and fitch by binding itself round them, it is called orobanche; and in a similar way wheat is attacked by darnel, barley by a long-stalked plant called acgilops and lentils by an axe-leaved which the greeks call axe-grass from its resemblance; these also kill the plants by twining round them. in the neighbourhood of philippi they give the name of ateramum to a weed growing in rich soil that kills the bean plant, and the name teramum to one that has the same effect in thin soil, when a particular wind has been blowing on the beans when damp. darnel has a very small seed enclosed in a prickly husk. when used in bread it very quickly causes fits of giddiness, and it is said that in asia and greece when the managers of baths want to get rid of a crowd they throw darnel seed on to hot coals. also the phalangium, a little creature of the spider class, breeds in the fitch, if there is a wet winter. slugs breed amongst vetch, and sometimes small snails which are produced from the ground and eat away the vetch in a surprising manner. - these broadly speaking are the diseases of grain.
