perdieium or parthenium or, to give it yet another name, sideritis, is another plant, called by some of our countrymen urceolaris, by others astercoin. it has a leaf similar to that of basil, only darker, and it grows on tiles and among ruins. pounded and sprinkled with a pinch of salt it cures the same diseases as dead-nettle, all of them, and is administered in the same way. the juice too taken hot is good for abscesses, and is remarkably good for convulsions, ruptures, bruises caused by slipping or by falling from a height, for instance, when vehicles overturn. a household slave, a favourite of pericles, first citizen of athens, when engaged in building the temple on the acropolis, crawled on the top of the high roof and fell. he is said to have been cured by this plant, which in a dream was prescribed to pericles by minerva; therefore it began to be called parthenium, and was consecrated to that goddess. this is the slave whose portrait was cast in bronze, the famous entrail roaster.
