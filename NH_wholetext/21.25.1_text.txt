but - by heaven! - italy herself has given the petellium its name, an autumn flower growing near brambles and esteemed only for its colour, which is that of the wild rose. it has five small petals. a wonderful thing about this flower is that the head bends over, and from the joints grow curved petals inclosing yellow seed forming a small corolla of several colours. the bellio too is yellow, with fifty-five lozenge-shaped little beards. these meadow flowers are used for chaplets, but most of such flowers are of no use and therefore without names. nay, these very flowers are differently named by different people.
