with nicias is compared athenion of maronea, and sometimes to the disadvantage of the former. athenion was a pupil of glaucion of corinth; he is more sombre in his colour than nicias and yet therewithal more pleasing, so that his extensive knowledge shines out in his actual painting. he painted a cavalry captain in the temple at eleusis and at athens the group of figures which has been called the family group, and also an achilles disguised in female dress detected by odysseus, a group of six figures in a single picture, and a groom with a horse, which has specially contributed to his fame. if he had not died in youth, there would have been nobody to compare with him.
