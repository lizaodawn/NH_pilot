about the bitter vetch i have said a few things in my note concerning it, a pulse to which, applied in vinegar, old authorities attributed a power no less than that they did to cabbage for snake bites and for those of crocodiles and of men. if anybody eats it fasting every day, the spleen, according to very reliable authorities, is reduced in size. its meal removes not only pimples from the face but also spots from the skin on all parts of the body. it does not allow sores to spread, being very efficacious when they are on the breasts. applied in wine it makes carbuncles burst. strangury, flatulence, affections of the liver, tenesmus, and atrophy, when food cannot be assimilated, are relieved by swallowing the roasted grain, held together by honey of the size of a filbert, and so are skin eruptions by a decoction in vinegar, allowed to remain on the affected part till the fourth day. an application in honey prevents superficial abscesses from suppurating. fomentation with the water of a decoction cures chilblains and pruritus. moreover it is thought that the whole body assumes a more healthy complexion if this decoction be taken daily on an empty stomach. at the same time this vetch makes unwholesome human food, causing vomiting, disturbing the bowels, and causing heaviness in the head and stomach, besides enfeebling the knees. soaked, however, for several days it mellows, and is very good for cattle and beasts of burden. the pods of it, pounded green before they harden, with their own stalk and leaves, dye the hair black.
