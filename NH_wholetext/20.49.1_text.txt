rocket seed cures the poisons of scorpions and of the shrewmouse; it keeps off all the little parasites breeding on the body, and removes spots on the skin of the face when applied with honey, freckles when applied with vinegar, reducing livid scars to whiteness when mixed with ox-gall. taken in wine it is said to harden as it were the feeling of those about to be flogged. as a seasoning for dishes it imparts such a pleasant flavour that the greeks have called it cuzomon (good broth). it is thought that if the eyes are fomented with slightly pounded rocket, clearness of vision is restored ... the coughing of babies is soothed. a decoction of its root in water extracts broken bones. we have already spoken of rocket as an aphrodisiac; if three leaves of wild rocket plucked with the left hand and pounded are drunk in hydromel, they so act.
