next an account must be given of the mines and ores of iron. iron serves as the best and the worst part of the apparatus of life, inasmuch as with it we plough the ground, plant trees, trim the trees that prop our vines, force the vines to renew their youth yearly by ridding them of decrepit growth; with it we build houses and quarry rocks, and we employ it for all other useful purposes, but we likewise use it for wars and slaughter and brigandage, and not only in hand-to-hand encounters but as a winged missile, now projected from catapults, now hurled by the arm, and now actually equipped with feathery wings, which i deem the most criminal artifice of man's genius, inasmuch as to enable death to reach human beings more quickly we have taught iron how to fly and have given wings to it. let us therefore debit the blame not to nature, but to man. a number of attempts have been made to enable iron to be innocent. we find it an express provision included in the treaty granted by porsena to the roman nation after the expulsion of the kings that they should only use iron for purposes of agriculture; and our oldest authors have recorded that in those days it was customary to write with a bone pen. there is extent an edict of pompey the great dated in his third consulship at the time of the disorders accompanying the death of clodius, prohibiting the possession of any weapon in the city.
