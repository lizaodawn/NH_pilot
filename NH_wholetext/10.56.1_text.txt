birds' dispositions also are equally varied, especially in respect of food. those called goat-suckers, which resemble a rather large blackbird, are night thieves â€” for they cannot see in the daytime. they enter the shepherds' stalls and fly to the goats' udders in order to suck their milk, which injures the udder and makes it perish, and the goats they have milked in this way gradually go blind. there is a bird called the shoveller-duck which flies up to the sea-divers and seizes their heads in its bill till it wrings their catch from them. the same bird after filling itself by swallowing shells brings them up again when digested by the warmth of the belly and so picked out from them the edible parts, discarding the shells.
