the natural differences shown by musts are these. they are white, dark, or of a colour between the two: from some there can be made wine, from others raisin wine. manufacture makes innumerable differences, so that the general survey that follows will have to suffice. all must is injurious to the stomach but comforting to the veins. if drunk rapidly after a bath without taking breath, death ensues. it is an antidote to the poisonous nature of cantharicles and to the bites of serpents, especially of haemorrhois and of the salamander. it causes headache, and is injurious to the throat, but good for kidneys, liver, intestines and bladder, for it makes these organs smooth. it is particularly efficacious against the buprestis, opium, curdled milk, hemlock, poisons and dorycninm; it should be taken in oil and brought up again by vomitings. for all purposes white must is the weaker; raisin must is more pleasant, besides causing less headache.
