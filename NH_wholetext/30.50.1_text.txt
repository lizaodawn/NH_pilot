the lice of phthiriasis even of the whole body are destroyed in three days by taking in drink the maggots, east slough of a snake, or by drinking, with a little salt, whey after the cheese has been taken out. they say that if the brain of a weasel is added to rennet, cheeses neither go rotten through age nor are touched by mice. if the ash too of a weasel is given to poultry or pigeons in their mash, they are said to be safe from weasels. pains of draught animals in making urine are ended by a bat put on them as an amulet, and hots by a woodpigeon carried three times round their middle. wonderful to relate, the woodpigeon on being set free dies, while the animal is at once freed from pain.
