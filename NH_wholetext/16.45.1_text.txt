the only trees that bear no fruit — i mean not even seed — are the tamarisk, which is of no use except for making brooms, the poplar, the alder, the atinian elm and the alaternus, the leaves of which are between those of the holm-oak and the olive; but trees that never grow from seed nor bear fruit are considered to be unlucky and under a curse. cremutius states that the tree from which phyllis hanged herself is never green. people open gum-producing trees after they have budded, but the gum does not thicken until after the fruit has been removed.
