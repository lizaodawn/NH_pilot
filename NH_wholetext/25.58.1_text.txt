echios of either kind is like pennyroyal its foliage is used for chaplets. the dose is two drachmae in four cyathi of wine; likewise with the second kind, which is marked by a prickly down, and also has little heads like a viper's; this is taken in wine and vinegar. some give the name echios to personata ('masked plant') whose leaf is broader than that of any kind, and which bears large burs. a decoction of the root of this is given with vinegar as a draught. henbane crushed with the leaves on is given in wine, especially for the poison of asps.
