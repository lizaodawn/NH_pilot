we have already stated, in treating of olive-oil, what kinds of olive trees cato tells us to plant and in what kind of soil, and what aspect he advises for olive-yards. mago recommends that on sloping ground and in dry positions and in a clay soil they should be planted between autumn and the middle of winter, but in heavy or damp or watery soil between harvest and the middle of winter â€” though it must be understood that he gave this advice for africa. italy at any rate, at the present time, does its planting chiefly in spring, but if one chooses to plant in autumn as well, there are only four days of the forty between the equinox and the setting of the pleiades on which it injures olives to be planted. it is peculiar to africa that it grafts them on a wild olive, in a soft of everlasting sequence, as when they begin to get old the shoot next for engrafting is put in and so another young tree grows out of the same one and the process is repeated as often as is necessary, so that the same olive-yards go on for generations. the wild olive however is propagated both by grafting and by inoculation.
