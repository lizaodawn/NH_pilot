scorpions live on earth. snakes are specially fond of wine when they have the chance, though otherwise they need little drink; they also need very little food, and almost none at all when they are kept shut up; just as do spiders also, which otherwise live by suction. consequently no venomous creature dies of hunger or thirst; for they have neither heat nor blood, nor yet sweat, which increases appetite by its natural salt. all in this class are more deadly if they have eaten their own kind before they attack somebody. the class of dog-headed apes and orang-utans stores food in the recesses of the jawbones, and then gradually takes it out from there with its hands to chew it â€” and what with ants is an annual ceremony is for these a daily or hourly practice. the only animal with toes that lives on grass is the hare; solid-hooved animals live on grass and corn, and among animals with cloven feet the pig eats all kinds of fodder and also roots. rolling on the ground is peculiar to animals with solid hooves. all species with serrated teeth are carnivorous. bears also eat grain, leaves, grapes and fruits and bees, and even crabs and ants. wolves, as we have said, when hungry even eat earth. cattle grow fat with drinking, and consequently salt is specially suitable for them. so also do beasts of burden, although they also fatten on corn and grass; in fact they eat in proportion to what they have drunk. beside the ruminants already mentioned, of forest animals stags ruminate when they are kept by us; but they all ruminate lying down in preference to standing, and in winter more than in summer, for a period of about seven months. the mice of pontus also remasticate their food in a similar manner.
