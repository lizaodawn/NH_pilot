for it is proper to append the artists famous with the brush in a minor style of painting. among these was piraeicus, to be ranked below few painters in skill; it is possible that he won distinction by his choice of subjects, inasmuch as although adopting a humble line he attained in that field the height of glory. he painted barbers' shops and cobblers' stalls, asses, viands and the like, consequently receiving a greek name meaning 'painter of sordid subjects'; in these however he gives exquisite pleasure, and indeed they fetched bigger prices than the largest works of many masters. on the other hand 'a picture by serapio,' says varro, 'covered the whole of the maenian balconies at the place beneath the old shops.' serapio was a most successful scene-painter, but he could not paint a human being. on the contrary, dionysius painted nothing else but people, and consequently has a greek name meaning 'painter of human beings.' callicles also made small pictures, and so did calates of subjects taken from comedy; both classes were painted by antiphilus, who executed the famous picture of hesione and an alexander and a philip with athene which are now in the school in octavia's porticoes, and in philippus' portico a father liber or dionysus, a young alexander, hippolytus alarmed by the bull rushing upon him, and in pompey's portico a cadmus and europa. he also painted a figure in an absurd costume known by the joking name of gryllus, the name consequently applied to every picture of that sort. he was himself born in egypt and a pupil of ctesidemus.
