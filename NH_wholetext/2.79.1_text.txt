the actual period of a day has been differently kept by different people: the babylonians count the period between two sunrises, the athenians that between two sunsets, the umbrians from midday to midday, the common people everywhere from dawn to dark, the roman priests and the authorities who fixed the official day, and also the egyptians and hipparchus, the period from midnight to midnight. but it is obvious that the breaks in daylight between sunset and sunrise are smaller near the solstice than at the equinoxes, because the position of the zodiac is more slanting around its middle points but straighter near the solstice.
