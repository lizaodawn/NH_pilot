the first and second kinds not only carry off the smaller four-footed animals but actually do battle with stags. the eagle collects a quantity of dust by rolling in it, and perching on the stag's horns sakes it off into its eyes, striking its head with its wings, until it brings it down on to the rocks. nor is it content with one foe: it has a fiercer battle with a great serpent, and one that is of much more doubtful issue, even though it is in the air. the serpent with mischievous greed tries to get the eagle's eggs; consequently the eagle carries it off wherever seen. the serpent fetters its wings by twining itself round them in manifold coils so closely that it falls to the ground itself with the snake.
