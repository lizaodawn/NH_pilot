the rush, having a fragile stalk and being a marsh plant, is not rightly to be reckoned in the class of bushes or of brambles or plants with stalks, nor yet among herbaceous plants, or in any other class except its own; it is used for making thatch and mats, and stripped of its outer coat serves for candles and funeral torches. in some places rushes are stronger and stiffer, for they are used to carry sails not only by boatmen on the po but also at sea by the african fisherman, who hangs his sail in a preposterous fashion, between masts, and the moors use them for roofing their cabins; and if one looks closely into the matter, rushes may appear to occupy the place held by the papyrus in the inner region of the world.
