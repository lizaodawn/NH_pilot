in former generations people even got their surnames from trees: for instance frondicius, the soldier who performed such remarkable exploits against hannibal, swimming across the volturnus with a screen of foliage on his head, and the licinian family of the stolones â€” stolo being the word for the useless suckers growing on the actual trees, on account of which the first stolo received the name from his invention of a process of trimming vines. in early days trees even were protected by the law, and the twelve tables provided that anybody wrongfully felling another man's trees should be fined 25 asses for each tree. what are we to think? that people of old who rated even fruit-trees so highly believed that trees would rise to the value mentioned above? and in the matter of fruit-trees no less marvellous are many of those in the districts surrounding the city, the produce of which is every year knocked down to bids of 2000 sesterces per tree, a single tree yielding a larger return than farms used to do in old days. it was on this account that grafting, and the practice of adultery even by trees, was devised, so that not even fruit should grow for the poor. we will now therefore state in what manner it chiefly comes about that such a large revenue is derived from these trees, going on to set forth the genuine and perfect method of cultivation, and for that purpose we shall not treat of the commonly known facts and those which we observe to be established, but of uncertain and doubtful points on which practical conduct chiefly goes wrong; as it is not our plan to give careful attention to superfluities. but first of all we will speak about matters of climate and soil that concern all kinds of trees in common.
