first of all it is almost impossible to explain the system of the actual days of the year and that of the movement of the sun, because to the 365 days an intercalary year adds a quarter of a day and of a night, and consequently definite periods of the stars cannot be stated. in addition to this there is the admitted obscurity of the facts, as sometimes the specification of the seasons runs in advance, and by a considerable number of days (the greek term for this is προχειμάζειν), whereas at other times it comes behind (in greek έπιχειμάζειν), and in general the influence of the heavens falls down to the earth in one place more quickly and in another place more slowly; this is the cause of the remark we commonly hear on the return of fine weather, that a constellation has been completed. moreover although all these things depend on stars that are stationary and fixed in the sky, there intervene movements of stars and hailstorms and rain, these also having no inconsiderable effect, as we have shown, and they disturb the regularity of the expectation that has been conceived. and we must not think that this occurs only to ourselves — it also deceives the rest of the animals, which have greater sagacity about this matter, inasmuch as it is a thing on which their life depends; and the birds of summer are killed by exceptionally late or exceptionally early frosts, and those of winter by untimely spells of heat. this is why virgil teaches the necessity of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the system of the planets also, warning us to watch the transit of the cold star saturn. some people think that butterflies are the most reliable sign of spring, on account of the extremely delicate structure of that insect; but in the very year in which i am writing this treatise it has been noticed that their supply has been three times annihilated by a return of cold weather, and that migratory birds arriving on january 27 brought a hope of spring that was soon dashed to the ground by a spell of very severe winter. the procedure is twofold: first of all it consists in trying to obtain a general principle from celestial phenomena, and then this principle has to be investigated by special signs. above all there is the variation due to the convexity of the world and the terrestrial globe, the same star revealing itself to different nations at a different time, with the consequence that its influence is not operative everywhere on the same days. additional difficulty has also been caused by authors through their observations having been taken in different regions, and because in the next place they actually publish different results of observations made in the same regions. but there were three main schools, the chaldean, the egyptian and the greek; and to these a fourth system was added in our own country [46 bc] by caesar during his dictatorship, who with the assistance of the learned astronomer sosigenes brought the separate years back into conformity with the course of the sun — and this theory itself was afterwards corrected (when an error had been found), so as to dispense with an intercalary day for a period of twelve successive years, for the reason that the year which had previously been getting in advance of the constellations had begun to lag behind in relation to them. both sosigenes himself in his three treatises — though more careful in research than the other writers he nevertheless did not hesitate to introduce an element of doubt by correcting his own statements — and also other authors whose names we prefixed to this volume a have published these theories, although it is seldom that the opinions of any two of them agree. this is less surprising in the case of the rest, as they had the excuse of difference of localities; but as for those who have differed in their views in the same country, we will give one case of disagreement as an example: the morning setting of the pleiades is given by hesiod — for there is extant an astronomical work that bears his name also — as taking place at the close of the autumnal equinox, whereas thales puts it on the 25th day after the equinox, anaximander on the 30th, euctemon on the 44th, and eudoxus on the 48th. we follow the observation of caesar specially: this will be the formula for italy; but we will also state the views of others, since we are not treating of a single country but of the whole of nature, though we shall not arrange them under the head of their authors, for that would be a lengthy matter, but of the regions concerned. only readers should remember that, for the sake of brevity, when attica is mentioned they must understand the cyclades islands to be included; when macedonia, magnesia and thrace; when egypt, phoenicia, cyprus and cilicia; when boeotia, locris and phocis and the adjoining regions always as well; when the dardanelles, the gallipoli peninsula as far as monte santo; when ionia, asia and the islands belonging to it; when the morea, achaia and the lands lying to the west of it; and the term chaldeans will indicate assyria and babylonia. that the names of africa and the provinces of spain and gaul are not mentioned will cause no surprise, because none of those who have published accounts of the risings of the constellations have made observations in respect of those countries. still it will not involve a difficult calculation to ascertain them in those countries as well, by means of the explanation of parallels which we have set out in book six, which indicates the astronomical relationship not only of nations but of individual cities as well. therefore by taking the circular parallel belonging to the countries we have specified and applying it to those that the particular student is seeking, the risings of the constellations will be the same throughout the parts of all the parallels where shadows are of equal length. it is also necessary to point out that the seasons themselves have their own periods every four years, and that they too return without great variation under the system of the sun, but that they are also lengthened every eight years at the hundredth revolution of the moon.
