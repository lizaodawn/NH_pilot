among the different kinds of brambles is one called rhamnos by the greeks, paler, more bushy, throwing out branches with straight thorns, not hooked like those of other brambles, and with larger leaves. the other kind of it is wild, darker and inclining to red, bearing a sort of pod. a decoction of the root of this in water makes a drug called lycium. the seed of it brings away the afterbirth. the other, the paler kind, is more astringent, cooling, and more suitable for the treatment of gatherings and wounds. the leaves of either kind, raw or boiled, are made up into an ointment with oil.
