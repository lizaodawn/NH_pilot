for scrofulous sores are prescribed plantain, the great celandine with honey and axle-grease, cinquefoil, root of persollata also with axle-grease — the application is covered with the plant's leaves — artemisia also and the root of mandrake in water. broad-leaved sideritis dug up with a nail in the left hand is attached as an amulet, but the healed patients must guard it, lest herbalists wickedly plant it again, as i have said in certain places, and bring about a relapse, a danger against which i find those also are warned who have been cured by artemisia, and those too cured by plantain. damasonium, which is also called alisma, is gathered at the solstice and applied in rainwater to the sores, the leaf being crushed, or the root pounded, with axle-grease, but the application must be covered with a leaf from the same plant. the same method is used for all pains in the neck and for tumours in any part of the body.
