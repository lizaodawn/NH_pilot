he states that there are two kinds of lions, one thickset and short, with comparatively curly manes - these being more timid than the long, straight-haired kind; the latter despise wounds. the males lift one leg in making water, like dogs. their smell is disagreeable, and not less their breath. they are infrequent drinkers, and they feed every other day, after a full meal occasionally abstaining from food for three days; when chewing they swallow whole what they can, and when their belly will not contain the result of their gluttony, they insert their clenched claws into their throats and drag it out, so that if they have to run away they may not go in a state of repletion. from the fact that many specimens are found lacking teeth he infers that they are long-lived. aemilianus's companion polybius states that in old age their favourite prey is a human being, because their strength is not adequate to hunting wild animals; and that at this period of their lives they beset the cities of africa, and consequently when he was with scipio he saw lions crucified, because the others might be deterred from the same mischief by fear of the same penalty.
