i know it is believed that trefoil is an antidote for the bite of snakes and scorpions, twenty grains of the seed being taken in a drink of wine or of vinegar and water, or leaves with the whole plant are boiled down to make a decoction; that snakes too arc never seen in trefoil; i know too that it is reported by famous authorities that twenty-five grains of the kind of trefoil i have called minyanthes serve as an antidote for all poisons, and that many other virtues besides are attributed to it as a remedy. but i am led to oppose their views by the authority of a very reliable man; for the poet sophocles asserts that it is a poisonous, as does simos also among the physicians, saying that the juice of the decocted or pounded plant, when poured upon the body, produces the same sensations of burning as those felt by persons bitten by a serpent, when this plant is applied to the wound. wherefore i should be of opinion that it should not be used otherwise than as a counter-poison. for perhaps this is one of the many cases where one poison is poisonous to other poisons. i have likewise noted that the seed of that trefoil the leaves of which are very small is useful, when applied as face-ointment, for preserving the loveliness of women's skin.
