crassus the rich was the first to make artificial leaves of silver or gold, giving chaplets of them as prizes at his games, to which were also added ribbons. for these to be attached increased the honour of the bare chaplet; this fashion was due to the etruscan chaplets, to which properly only golden ribbons were fastened. for a long time these ribbons were plain. the custom of engraving them originated with p. claudius pulcher, who also added gold-leaf to the inner bark of the lime tree.
