bricks should not be made from a sandy or gravelly soil and far less from a stony one, but from a marly and white soil or else from a red earth; or even with the aid of sand, at all events if coarse male sand is used. the best time for making bricks is in spring, as at midsummer they tend to crack. for buildings, only bricks two years old are recommended; moreover the material for them when it has been pounded should be well soaked before they are moulded.
