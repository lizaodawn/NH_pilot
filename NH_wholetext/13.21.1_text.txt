we have not yet touched on the marsh-plants nor the shrubs that grow by rivers. but before we leave egypt we shall also describe the nature of papyrus, since our civilization or at all events our records depend very largely on the employment of paper. according to marcus varro we owe even the discovery of paper to the victory of alexander the great, when he founded alexandria in egypt, before which time paper was not used. first of all people used to write on palm-leaves and then on the bark of certain trees, and afterwards folding sheets of lead began to be employed for official muniments, and then also sheets of linen or tablets of wax for private documents; for we find in homer that the use of writing-tablets existed even before the trojan period, but when he was writing even the land itself which is now thought of as egypt did not exist as such, while now paper grows in the sebennytic and saitic nomes of egypt, the land having been subsequently heaped up by the nile, inasmuch as homer wrote that the island of pharos, which is now joined to alexandria by a bridge, was twenty-four hours' distance by sailing-ship from the land. subsequently, also according to varro, when owing to the rivalry between king ptolemy and king eumenes about their libraries ptolemy suppressed the export of paper, parchment was invented at pergamum; and afterwards the employment of the material on which the immortality of human beings depends spread indiscriminately.
