i have already said where poisonous honey is found. a remedy is the gilthead fish taken in food. but if pure honey should cause nausea, or indigestion that becomes very acute, an antidote is, according to pelops, the decoction of a tortoise with the feet, head, and tail cut off; according to apelles, a similar decoction of a scincus; i have said what a scincus is. several times moreover i have said how poisonous is the menstrual fluid of women; against all forms of it, as i have said, the red mullet is a help, as it is against the stingray, land- and sea-scorpions, the weever fish, and poisonous spiders. it may be applied locally or taken in food. a fresh red mullet's head, reduced to ash, is an antidote to all poisons, being specific against poisonous fungi. they say that noxious charms cannot enter, or at least cannot harm, homes where a starfish, smeared with the blood of a fox, has been fastened to the upper lintel or to the door with a bronze nail.
