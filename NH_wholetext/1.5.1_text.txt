for my own part i am of opinion that a special in learning belongs to those who have preferred service of overcoming difficulties to the of giving pleasure; and i have myself done this in other works also, and i declare that i admire the famous writer livy when he begins a volume of his history of rome from the foundation of the city with the words 'i have already achieved enough of fame, and i might have retired to leisure, did not my restless mind find its sustenance in work.' for assuredly he ought to have composed his history for the glory of the world-conquering nation and of the roman name, not for his own; it would have been a greater merit to have persevered from love of the work, not for the sake of his own peace of mind, and to have rendered this service to the roman nation and not to himself. as domitus piso says, it is not books but storehouses that are needed; consequently by perusing about 2000 volumes, very few of which, owing to the abstruseness of their contents, are ever handled by students, we have collected in 36 volumes 20,000 noteworthy facts obtained from one hundred authors that we have explored, with a great number of other facts in addition that were either ignored by our predecessors or have been discovered by subsequent experience. nor do we doubt that there are many things that have escaped us also; for we are but human, and beset with duties, and we pursue this sort of interest in our spare moments, that is at night — lest any of your house should think that the night hours have been given to idleness. the days we devote to you, and we keep our account with sleep in terms of health, content even with this reward alone, that, while we are dallying (in varro's phrase) with these trifles, we are adding hours to our life — since of a certainty to be alive means to be awake. because of these reasons and these difficulties i dare make no promise; the very words i am writing to you are supplied by yourself. this guarantees my work, and this rates its value; many objects are deemed extremely precious just because of the fact that they are votive offerings.
