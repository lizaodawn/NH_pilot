the padus descends from the bosom of mount vesulus, one of the most elevated points of the chain of the alps, in the territories of the ligurian vagienni, and rises at its source in a manner that well merits an inspection by the curious; after which it hides itself in a subterranean channel until it rises again in the country of the forovibienses. it is inferior in fame to none whatever among the rivers, being known to the greeks as the eridanus and famous as the scene of the punishment of phaethon. at the rising of the dog-star it is swollen by the melted snows; but, though it proves more furious in its course to the adjoining fields than to the vessels that are upon it, still it takes care to carry away no portion of its banks, and when it recedes, renders them additionally fertile. its length from its source is 300 miles, to which we must add eighty-eight for its sinuosities; and it receives from the apennines and alps not only several navigable rivers, but immense lakes as well, which discharge themselves into its waters, thus conveying altogether as many as thirty streams into the adriatic sea.
