we have indeed stated that in the east, on the shores of the ocean, a number of races are in this necessitous condition; but so also are the races of people called the greater and the lesser chauci, whom we have seen in the north. there twice in each period of a day and a night the ocean with its vast tide sweeps in a flood over a measureless expanse, covering up nature's age-long controversy and the region disputed as belonging whether to the land or to the sea. there this miserable race occupy elevated patches of ground or platforms built up by hand above the level of the highest tide experienced, living in huts erected on the sites so chosen, and resembling sailors in ships when the water covers the surrounding land, but shipwrecked people when the tide has retired, and round their huts they catch the fish escaping with the receding tide. it does not fall to them to keep herds and live on milk like the neighbouring tribes, nor even to have to fight with wild animals, as all woodland growth is banished far away. they twine ropes of sedge and rushes from the marshes for the purpose of setting nets to catch the fish, and they scoop up mud in their hands and dry it by the wind more than by sunshine, and with earth as fuel warm their food and so their own bodies, frozen by the north wind. their only drink is supplied by storing rainwater in tanks in the forecourts of their homes. and these are the races that if they are nowadays vanquished by the roman nation say that they are reduced to slavery! that is indeed the case: fortune oft spares men as a punishment.
