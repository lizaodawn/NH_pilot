the best white hellebore is that which most quickly causes sneezing. it is, however, far more terrifying than the black sort, especially if one reads in our old authorities of the elaborate precautions, taken by those about to drink it, against shivering, choking, overpowering and unseasonable sleep, prolonged hiccough or sneezing, fluxes of the stomach, vomiting, too slow or too long, scanty or too excessive. in fact they usually gave other things to promote vomiting, and drove out the hellebore itself by medicine or enema, or more often they used even bleeding. furthermore, even when the hellebore proves successful, the various colours of the vomits are terrifying to see, and after the vomits comes the worry of watching the stools, of superintending the bath, of attention to the whole body, all these troubles being preceded by the great terror caused by its reputation, for it is said that meat, if boiled with it. is consumed. it was a fault of the ancient physicians that because of these fears they used to administer this hellebore in smallish doses, since the larger the dose the quicker it is eliminated. themison gave doses of not more than two drachmae; his successors actually increased the amount to four, because of the fine testimonial given to hellebore by herophilus, who compared it to a truly courageous general; having aroused all within, it itself marches out in the van. moreover, a wonderful discovery has been made; hellebore cut with scissors, as we have described, is passed through a sieve; the skin - with which they empty the stomach - remains behind, while the soft part passes through, and is given to stop the vomiting when the purging is too violent.
