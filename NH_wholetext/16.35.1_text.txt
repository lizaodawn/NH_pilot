each of the trees in its own kind has a permanent uniformity of leaf, with the exception of the poplar, the ivy and the croton (which, as we have said, is also called the cici). there are three kinds of poplars, the white, the black and the one called the leaf and which is very famous for the mushrooms libyan poplar, which has a very small and very dark that grow on it. the white poplar has a leaf of two colours, white on the upper side and green underneath. with this tree and the black poplar and the croton the leaves are exactly circular when young but project into angles when older; whereas the leaves of the ivy are angular at first but become round. from the leaves of the white poplar springs out a quantity of shiny white down, and when the foliage is specially thick the trees are white all over like fleeces. pomegranate and almond trees have reddish leaves.
