scolymus too has been adopted as a food in the east, where it has the further name of limonia. it is a shrub never more than a cubit high, with tufts of leaves and a dark but sweet root; eratosthenes too praises it as a valuable food for those of moderate means. it is said to be highly diuretic, to cure lichen and leprons sores when applied in vinegar, and according to hesiod and alcaeus, to be an aphrodisiac when taken in wine. they have written that when it is in blossom the song of the cricket is shrillest, women are most amorous and men most backward in sexual unions, as though it were through nature's providence that this stimulant is at its best when badly needed. offensive odour from the armpits is corrected by an ounce of the root, without the pith, in three heminae of falernian wine boiled down to one third, to be taken fasting after the bath and again after food, the dose being a cyathus at a time. xenocrates assures us of a remarkable thing, that he has proved by experiment, that the offensive smell passes off from the armpits by way of the urine.
