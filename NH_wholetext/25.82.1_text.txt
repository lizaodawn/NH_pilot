pericarpum is a kind of bulb. there are two species of it; one has a red outer skin, the other is like the dark poppy, but its properties are stronger than those of the former; both however are warming. for this reason the plant is administered to counteract hemlock, as is also frankincense and panaces, and chironium in particular. the last is also used for poisoning by fungi.
