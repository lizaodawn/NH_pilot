while on this subject we also must not omit the respect shown to this plant by the gallic provinces. the druids — that is what they call their magicians — hold nothing more sacred than mistletoe and a tree on which it is growing, provided it is a hard-oak. groves of hard-oaks are chosen even for their own sake, and the magicians perform no rites without using the foliage of those trees, so that it may be supposed that it is from this custom that they get their name of druids, from the greek word meaning 'oak'; but further, anything growing on oak-trees they think to have been sent down from heaven, and to be a sign that the particular tree has been chosen by god himself. mistletoe is, however, rather seldom found on a hard-oak, and when it is discovered it is gathered with great ceremony, and particularly on the sixth day of the moon (which for these tribes constitutes the beginning of the months and the years) and after every thirty years of a new generation, because it is then rising in strength and not one half of its full size. hailing the moon in a native word that means 'healing all things,' they prepare a ritual sacrifice and banquet beneath a tree and bring up two white bulls, whose horns are bound for the first time on this occasion. a priest arrayed in white vestments climbs the tree and with a golden sickle cuts down the mistletoe, which is caught in a white cloak. then finally they kill the victims, praying to god to render his gift propitious to those on whom he has bestowed it. they believe that mistletoe given in drink will impart fertility to any animal that is barren, and that it is an antidote for all poisons. so powerful is the superstition in regard to trifling matters that frequently prevails among the races of mankind.
