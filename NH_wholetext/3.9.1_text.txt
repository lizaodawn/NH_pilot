the first region of italy; the tiber; rome. the tiber or tiberis, formerly called thybris, and previously albula, flows down from nearly the central part of the chain of the apennines, in the territory of the arretini. it is at first small, and only navigable by means of sluices, in which the water is dammed up and then discharged, in the same manner as the timia and the glanis, which flow into it; for which purpose it is found necessary to collect the water for nine days, unless there should happen to be a fall of rain. and even then, the tiber, by reason of its rugged and uneven channel, is really more suitable for navigation by rafts than by vessels, for any great distance. it winds along for a course of 150 miles, passing not far from tifernum, perusia, and ocriculum, and dividing etruria from the umbri and the sabini, and then, at a distance of less than sixteen miles from the city, separating the territory of veii from that of crustuminum, and afterwards that of the fidenates and of latium from vaticanum.
