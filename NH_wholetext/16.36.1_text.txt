an exceptionally remarkable thing occurs in the case of the elm, lime, olive, white poplar and willow: after midsummer their leaves turn right round, and no other indication shows with greater certainty that the season is finished. also their leaves contain in themselves a variation that is common to all foliage: the under surface, towards the ground, is of a bright grass-green colour, and on the same side they are comparatively smooth, while on their upper part they have sinews and hard skin and articulations, but creases underneath like the human hand. the leaves of the olive are whiter and not so smooth on the upper side, and ivy-leaves the same. but the leaves of all trees open out every day towards the sun, as if intending their under side to be warmed. the upper side of all leaves has however small an amount of down upon it, which in some countries serves for wool.
