the territory of the eleans then begins, who were formerly called epei, with the city of elis in the interior, and, at a distance of twelve miles from phlious [pylos, pheia?], being also in the interior, the temple of olympian jupiter, which by the universal celebrity of its games, gives to greece its mode of reckoning. here too once stood the town of pisa, the river alpheus flowing past it. on the coast there is the promontory of ichthys. the river alpheus is navigable six miles, nearly as far as the towns of aulon and leprion. we next come to the promontory of platanodes. all these localities lie to the west.
