enough has been said about scented flowers. in this sphere luxury, glad to have conquered nature with its unguents, has with its dyed fabrics gone on to challenge those flowers that are commended for their colour. i note that the principal colours are the three following: (1) red, as of the kermes-insect, which, from the loveliness of the dark rose, shades, if you look up at it in a bright light, into tyrian purple, double-dyed purple and laconian purple; (2) amethyst, which from violet itself passes into purple, and which i have called ianthine. i am discussing general types of colour, which shade off into many kinds. (3) the third belongs properly to the purple of the murex, but includes many kindred shades. one is the colour of the heliotrope, sometimes of a light, though usually of a deeper, tint; another is that of the mallow, shading into a purple; yet a third, seen in the late violet, is the most vivid of the murex tints. at the present day nature and luxury are matched together and are fighting out a duel. i read that yellow was the earliest colour to be highly esteemed, but was granted as an exclusive privilege to women for their bridal veils, and that for this reason perhaps it is not included among the principal colours, that is, those common to men and women, since it is joint use that has given the principal colours their dignity.
