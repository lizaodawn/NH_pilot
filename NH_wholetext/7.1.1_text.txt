and about the human race as a whole we have in large part spoken in our account of the various nations. nor shall we now deal with manners and customs, which are beyond counting and almost as numerous as the groups of mankind; yet there are some that i think ought not to be omitted, and especially those of the people living more remote from the sea; some things among which i doubt not will appear portentous and incredible to many. for who ever believed in the ethiopians before actually seeing them? or what is not deemed miraculous when first it comes into knowledge? how many things are judged impossible before they actually occur? indeed the power and majesty of the nature of the universe at every turn lacks credence if one's mind embraces parts of it only and not the whole. not to mention peacocks, or the spotted skins of tigers and panthers and the colourings of so many animals, a small matter to tell of but one of measureless extent if pondered on is the number of national languages and dialects and varieties of speech, so numerous that a foreigner scarcely counts as a human being for someone of another race! again though our physiognomy contains ten features or only a few more, to think that among all the thousands of human beings there exist no two countenances that are not distinct â€” a thing that no art could supply by counterfeit in so small a number of specimens! nevertheless in most instances of these i shall not myself pledge my own faith, and shall preferably ascribe the facts to the authorities who will be quoted for all doubtful points: only do not let us be too proud to follow the greeks, because of their far greater industry or older devotion to study.
