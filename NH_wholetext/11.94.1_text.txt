viviparous species have bristles, but oviparous ones have feathers or scales, or shells like tortoises, or bare skin like snakes. feathers in all cases have hollow stalks; when cut off they do not grow again, but when plucked out others grow in their place. insects use fragile membranes to fly with, flying-fish fly over the sea with damp membranes and bats among houses with dry ones; the wings of bats also have joints.
