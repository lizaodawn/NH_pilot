both kinds of anagallis, taken in hydromel, are purgative, as is also epithymum, which is the blossom of the thyme like satureia. the only difference is that this has a grass-green flower, the other thyme a white one. some call it hippopheos. less beneficial to the stomach, it causes vomitings, but dispels colic and flatulence. as an electuary it is also taken with honey, and sometimes with iris, for chest troubles. from four to six drachmae with honey and a little salt and vinegar move the bowels. others give a different account of epithymum: that it grows without a root, has a small head like a little hood, is red in colour and is dried in the shade, and a dose of half an acetabulum, taken in water, carries off phlegm and bile, acting as a gentle aperient.
