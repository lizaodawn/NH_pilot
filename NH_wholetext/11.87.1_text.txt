also the animals that do not get fat have hard bones; those of asses are resonant enough to use as flutes. dolphins being viviparous have bones and not spines, but snakes have spines. soft aquatic species have no bones, but rings of flesh bound round the body, for instance the two kinds of cuttlefish. insects also are said to be equally devoid of bones. the gristly aquatic species have marrow in the spine, and seals have gristle, not bones. similarly with all that have ears and nostrils that just project these are soft and flexible, nature thus insuring them against fracture. when gristle is burst it does not join up, and when bones are amputated they do not grow again, except the bone between the hoof and the hock in beasts of burden. human beings grow taller to the age of twenty-one and from then onward fill out; but more particularly at the period of puberty they are noticed to get free from a sort of impediment to their growth, and especially so in sickness.
