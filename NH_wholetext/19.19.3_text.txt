cato sings the praises of garden cabbages; people in old days used to estimate farmers by their garden-produce and thus at once to give a verdict that there was a bad mistress in the house where the garden outside, which used to be called the woman's responsibility, was neglected, as it meant having to depend on the butcher or the market for victuals. nor did people approve very highly of vegetables as they do now, since they condemned delicacies that require another delicacy to help them down. this meant economizing oil, since it was actually counted as a reproach to need a rich sauce. those products of the garden were most in favour which needed no fire for cooking and saved fuel, and which were a resource in store and always ready; whence their name of salads, easy to digest and not calculated to overload the senses with food, and least adapted to stimulate the appetite. the fact that one set of herbs is devoted to seasoning shows that it used to be customary to do one's borrowing at home, and that there was no demand for indian pepper and the luxuries that we import from overseas. indeed the lower classes in the city used to give their eyes a daily view of country scenes by means of imitation gardens in their windows, before the time when atrocious burglaries in countless numbers compelled them to bar out all the view with shutters. therefore let vegetables also have their need of honour and do not let things be robbed of respect by the fact of their being common, especially as we see that vegetables have supplied even the names of great families, and a branch of the valerian family were not ashamed to bear the surname lettuce. moreover some gratitude may attach to our labour and research on the ground that virgil also confessed how difficult it is to provide such small matters with dignified appellations.
