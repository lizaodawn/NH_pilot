from doriscus there is a winding coast as far as macron tichos, or the "long wall," a distance of 122 miles; round doriscus flows the river melas, from which the gulf of melas receives its name. the towns are, cypsela, bisanthe, and macron tichos, already mentioned, so called because a wall extends from that spot between the two seas, â€” that is to say, from the propontis to the gulf of melas, thus excluding the chersonesus, which projects beyond it.
