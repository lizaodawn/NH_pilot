about galbanum i have already spoken. the best kind is considered to be that which is neither moist nor dry, and such as i have indicated. it is taken in drink by itself for chronic cough, asthma, ruptures and sprains; it is used as an application for sciatica, pains in the sides, superficial abscesses, boils, separation of flesh from bones, scrofulous sores, knotty lumps at the joints, and tooth-ache. with honey too it makes an ointment for sores on the head. with rose oil or nard it is injected for pus in the ears. its smell is beneficial for epilepsy, choking of the uterus, and for weakness of the stomach. a pessary or fumigation brings away the foetus when there is a miscarriage, and so will a branch of hellebore smeared with it and laid under the woman. i have said that snakes are kept off by the fumes caused by burning it; they do not come either near persons rubbed with galbanum. it heals also scorpion stings. a piece the size of a bean is taken in a cyathus of wine for difficult deliveries, and it reduces a displaced uterus; while with myrrh and wine it brings away a dead foetus. with myrrh and wine it also counteracts poisons, particularly those used on arrows. mixed with oil and spondylium it kills snakes if it but touches them. it is supposed to make urination difficult.
