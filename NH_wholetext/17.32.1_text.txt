it remains to give an account of those which are grown as supports for other trees, particularly for vines, and which are felled for timber. among these the first place is taken by willows, which arc planted in a damp place, but in a hole dug two and a half feet deep, a truncheon or rod 18 inches long being used, the stouter the more serviceable. they should be set six feet apart. when three years old they are lopped off two feet from the ground to make them spread out wide and to enable them to be cut back without using ladders; for the willow is the more productive the nearer it is to the ground. it is advised that these frees also should be dug round every year, in april. this is the mode of cultivating the osier willow. the stake willow is grown both from a rod and from a truncheon, in a hole of the same depth. it is proper to cut rods from it in about three years; but these also fill up the place of trees that are growing old, by means of a layered new growth cut off after a year. a single acre of osier-willow will supply enough for 25 acres of vineyard. the white poplar is also grown for the same purpose, the hole being two feet deep and the cutting eighteen inches long and left two days to dry; the truncheons are planted one foot nine inches apart and a layer of earth a yard deep is thrown on the top of them.
