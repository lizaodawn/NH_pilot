the second kind of tithymallus is called myrtites by some, and caryites by others, having leaves like those of the myrtle, pointed and prickly, but larger, and growing like the first kind in rough ground. its heads are gathered when the barley is beginning to swell, dried in the shade for nine days and thoroughly dried in the sun. the fruit does not ripen all together, but a part in the following year. it is called the nut, and for this reason the greeks have surnamed this tithymallus earyites. it is gathered when the harvest is ready, washed, and then dried. it is given with twice the amount of black poppy, the dose being one acetabulum altogether. it is a less violent emetic than the preceding, as are also the others. some have given the leaf also in a similar dose, the nut however by itself in honey wine or raisin wine, or with sesame. it carries off phlegm and bile by stool. sores in the mouth it cures, but for corroding ulcers in the mouth the leaf is eaten with honey.
