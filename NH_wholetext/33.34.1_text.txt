antimony has astringent and cooling properties, but it is chiefly used for the eyes, since this is why even a majority of people have given it a greek name meaning 'wide-eye,' because in beauty-washes for women's eyebrows it has the property of magnifying the eyes. made into a powder with powdered frankincense and an admixture of gum it checks fluxes and ulcerations of the eyes. it also arrests discharge of blood from the brain, and is also extremely effective with a sprinkling of its powder against new wounds and old dog-bites and against burns if mixed with fat and litharge of silver, or lead acetate and wax. it is prepared by being smeared round with lumps of ox and burnt in ovens, and then cooled down with women's milk and mixed with rain water and pounded in mortars. and next the turbid part is poured off into a copper vessel after being purified with soda. the lees are recognized by being full of lead, and they settle to the bottom of the mortars and art thrown away. then the vessel into which the turbid part was poured off is covered with a cloth and left for a night, and the next day anything floating on the surface is poured off or removed with a sponge. the sediment on the bottom is considered the choicest part and is covered with a linen cloth and put to dry in the sun but not allowed to become very dry, and is ground up a second time in the mortar and divided into small tablets. but it is above all essential to limit the amount of heat applied to it, so that it may not be turned into lead. some people do not employ dung in boiling it but fat. others pound it in water and strain it through three thicknesses of linen cloth and throw away the dregs, and pour off the liquor that comes through, collecting all the deposit at the bottom, and this they use as an ingredient in plasters and eyewashes.
