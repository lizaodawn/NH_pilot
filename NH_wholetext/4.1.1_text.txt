epirus: the third great gulf of europe begins at the mountains of acroceraunia, and ends at the hellespont, embracing an extent of 2500 miles, exclusive of the sea-line of nineteen smaller gulfs. upon it are epirus, acarnania, aitolia, phocis, locris, achaia, messenia, laconia, argolis, megaris, attica, boeotia; and again, upon the other sea, the same phocis and locris, doris, phthiotis, thessalia, magnesia, macedonia and thracia. all the fabulous lore of greece, as well as the effulgence of her literature, first shone forth upon the banks of this gulf. we shall therefore dwell a little the longer upon it.
