the greeks give the name cisthos, which is very like cissos (ivy), to a shrub larger than thyme and with leaves like those of ocimum. there are two kinds of it; the flower of the male is rose-coloured, of the female, white. both are good for dysentery and looseness of the bowels, the dose being as much of the blossom as can be taken in three fingers, this quantity to be swallowed in a dry wine twice a day; for chronic ulcers and for burns the blossom is applied with wax, and by itself for ulcers in the mouth. it is especially under these shrubs that there grows the hypocisthis, which i shall describe when i treat of herbs.
