we have already specified the species of which the males have genital organs behind them. these organs are bony in wolves, foxes, weasels and ferrets, which also furnish sovereign remedies for stone in man. in the bear too it is said, these organs become horny as soon as the animal dies. the eastern peoples think that this organ in the camel makes a most reliable bowstring. there are also certain racial distinctions in connexion with it, and even varieties of ritual, the galli, priests of the mother of the gods, practising amputation within the limits of injury. on the other hand in a few women there is a curious resemblance to the male organ, [clitoris? ] as there is in hermaphrodites of either sex, a thing that i believe first occurred with the class of quadrupeds also in the principate of nero: at all events nero used to show off a team of hermaphrodite mares, that he had found in the treviri district in gaul, harnessed to his chariot, apparently deeming it a very remarkable spectacle to see the emperor of the world riding in a miraculous carriage.
