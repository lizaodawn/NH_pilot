the greeks have distinguished three kinds of lettuce, one with so broad a stalk that it is said that the wicket-gates of kitchen gardens are often made of them; these plants have leaves rather larger than those of the green garden-lettuce, and extremely narrow, the nutriment being apparently used up elsewhere; the second kind has a round stalk, and the third is a squat-growing plant, called the spartan lettuce. other people have classified lettuces by colour and season of sowing, saying that the black lettuce is the kind sown in january, the white in march and the red in april, and that all of these kinds can be transplanted at the end of two months. more precise authorities make a larger number of varieties, the purple, the crinkly, the cappadocian, the greek â€” the last with a smoother leaf and a broad stalk, and in addition the lettuce with a long and narrow leaf, which resembles endive; while the worst kind of all has been given the name in greek of bitter lettuce, in condemnation of its bitter taste. there is moreover another variety of white lettuce the greek name for which is poppy-lettuce, from its abundance of juice with a soporific property, although all the lettuces are believed to bring sleep; this was the only kind of lettuce in italy in early times, which accounts for the latin name for lettuce, derived from the latin for milk. a purple lettuce with a very large root is called caecilius's lettuce, while a round one with a very small root and broad leaves is called in greek the anti-aphrodisiac, or otherwise the eunuch's lettuce, because this kind is an extremely potent check to amorous propensities. indeed they all have a cooling quality, and consequently are acceptable in summer. they relieve the stomach of distaste for food and promote appetite. at all events it is stated that the late lamented augustus in an illness, thanks to the sagacity of his doctor, musa, was cured by lettuce, which had been refused him by the excessive scruples of his previous doctor, gaius aemilius; this was such a good advertisement for lettuces that the method was then discovered of keeping them into the months when they are out of season, pickled in honey-vinegar. it is also believed that lettuces increase the blood-supply.
