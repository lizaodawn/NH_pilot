another similar tree is the one called by the ionians the ceronia, which also buds from the trunk, the fruit being a pod, which has consequently been called by some the egyptian fig. but this is clearly a mistake, as it does not grow in egypt but in syria and ionia, and also in the neighbourhood of cnidus and on the island of rhodes. it is always in full foliage, and it has a white flower with a powerful scent. it sends out shoots at the lower parts, and consequently is of a yellow colour above ground, as the suckers drain away the sap. if the fruit of the preceding year is picked about the rising of the dog-star, it at once grows a second crop, after which it blossoms through the period of the bear-ward, and the winter nourishes its fruit.
