the gulfs of the red sea: we will now trace the rest of the coast that lies opposite to that of arabia. timosthenes has estimated the length of the whole gulf at four days' sail, and the breadth at two, making the straits to be seven miles and a half in width. eratosthenes says that the length of the shore from the mouth of the gulf is thirteen hundred miles on each side, while artemidorus states that the length on the arabian side is seventeen hundred and fifty miles, and that along the troglodytic coast, to ptolemais, the distance is eleven hundred and thirty-seven and a half. agrippa, however, maintains that there is no difference whatever in the length of the two sides, and makes it seventeen hundred and twenty-two miles. most writers mention the length as being four hundred and seventy-five miles, and make the straits to face the southeast, being twelve miles wide according to some, fifteen according to others.
