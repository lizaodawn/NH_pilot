well then, in the months that we have specified, the tiny seed-balls are gathered from the female cypress — for the male tree, as we have said, is barren — and are put to dry in the sun; and they burst open and emit their seed, which has a remarkable attraction for ants, a fact that actually increases the marvel, for the germ of such huge trees to be consumed for the food of such a small animal! the seed is sown in april, after the earth has been levelled by means of rollers or rammers; it is scattered thickly and a layer of earth a thumb deep is sprinkled upon it from sieves: it is not strong enough to rise up against a greater weight, and it twists back under the ground; on this account another method is merely to tread it into the earth. every three days it is given a light watering, after sunset so as to soak in the moisture even, until the plants break out from the earth. they are transplanted after a year, when the seedling is nine inches long, regard being paid to the weather so that they may be planted under a bright sky and when there is no wind. and wonderful to say, on that day and that day only it is dangerous for them if there is the smallest sprinkle of rain or a breath of wind; whereas for the future the plants are continually safe and secure, and later on they have a dislike for humidity. jujube-trees are also grown from seed sown in april. tuber-apples are better grafted on the wild plum, the quince or the buckthorn bush, the last being a wild thorn. any thorn also takes grafts of the sebesten-plum extremely well, and also takes the sorb-plum satisfactorily.
