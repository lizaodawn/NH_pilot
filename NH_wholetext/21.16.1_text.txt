baccar (valerian?) too, called by some field nard, has scent in the root only. that unguents used to be made by the ancients from this root we have a witness in aristophanes, a poet of the old comedy. whence some used to commit the error of calling it by a greek name, baccaris. the scent is very like that of cinnamon. it grows on a thin dry soil. very like it is the plant called combretum, taller than the baccar, and with leaves so thin that they are mere threads. these are only used as unguents. but the mistake of those also must be corrected who have called baccar field nard. for there is another plant with this surname, which the greeks call asaron, whose shape and appearance we have described among the varieties of nard. moreover, i find that the plant is styled asaron, because it is not used in the making of chaplets.
