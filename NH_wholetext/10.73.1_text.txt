the reproductive system of birds appears to be simple, although even this possesses marvels of its own, since even four-footed creatures produce eggs â€” chamaeleons and lizards and those we have specified among aquatic species, and also snakes. but among feathered creatures those that have hooked talons are unfertile. of these only the lesser kestrel produces more than four eggs at a time. nature has bestowed on the bird kind the attribute that the species among them that are shy are more prolific than the brave ones; only ostriches, hens and partridges bear very numerous broods. birds have two methods of coupling, the hen sitting on the ground as in the case of the domestic fowl or standing up as in the case of the crane.
