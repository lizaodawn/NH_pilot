particular trees are attacked by worm in a greater or smaller degree, but nearly all are liable, and birds detect worm-eaten wood by the hollow sound when they tap the bark. nowadays indeed even this has begun to be classed as a luxury, and specially large wood-maggots found in oak-wood - the name for these is cosses - figure in the menu as a special delicacy, and actually even these creatures are fed with flour to fatten them for the table. the trees most liable to be worm-eaten are pears, apples, and figs; those that have a bitter taste and a scent are less liable. of the maggots found in fig-trees some breed in the trees themselves, but others are produced by the insect called in greek the horned insect; all of them however assume the shape of that insect, and emit a little buzzing sound. also the service-tree is infected with red, hairy caterpillars, which eventually kill it; and the medlar as well is liable to the same disease when it grows old.
