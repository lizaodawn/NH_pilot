'o famous champion of our latin tongue, where grows with a fairer green the grove you bade rise, and the villa, honoured by the name of academe, vetus keeps in repair under a more careful tendance, here are also to be seen waters not revealed before, which with drops infused relieve wearied eyes. for indeed the site itself gave this gift as an honour to cicero its master, when it disclosed springs with this healing power, so that, since he is read throughout the whole world, there may be more waters to give sight to eyes.'
