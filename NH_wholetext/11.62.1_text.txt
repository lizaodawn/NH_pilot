the asp and serpent have similar teeth, but two extremely long ones on the right and left side of the upper jaw, perforated by a slender tube like the stings of the scorpion, which inject poison. the most accurate authorities write that this poison is nothing else than the serpents' gall, and that veins pass from the gall-bladder under the spine to the mouth; certain writers say that it is only one tooth, and that as it is hooked it is sloped backward when it has inflicted a bite; some authorities state that it then falls out and afterwards grows again, as it is very easy to dislodge, and that the snakes that we see handled lack this tooth; and that the scorpion has this tooth in its tail - as according to most authorities it has three. the vipers' teeth are concealed in its gum. their gum is charged with the same poison, and when squeezed by the pressure of the teeth pours out its venom into the bites inflicted. no winged creature except the bat has teeth. the camel is the only animal without horns that has not got front teeth in the upper jaw. no horned animal has serrated teeth. even snails have teeth; this is proved by the fact that even the smallest of them gnaw vetches. but i wonder what possible ground there is for the view that among marine species shell-fish and cartilaginous fish have front teeth, and also that sea-urchins have five. insects have stings instead of teeth. the monkey has teeth like those of a human being. the elephant has four inner teeth for masticating, and besides these the prominent tusks that are bent backward in the male and slope straight downward in the female. the sea-mouse that swims in front of the whale has no teeth, but instead of them its mouth inside and also its tongue and palate are set with bristles. of land animals very small quadrupeds have two extremely long front teeth in each jaw.
