a woman's milk produced before the seventh month is of no use, but from that month, when the embryo is alive, it is healthy. with the females of most species milk flows from the whole of the dugs and even from the fold of the shoulder-blades. camels have milk until they are in foal again; camel's milk is thought to be most agreeable if three parts of water are added to one of milk. a cow does not have milk before calving; and after the first calving there are always biestings, which condense into a sort of foam unless water is mixed with them. asses in foal begin to give milk at once. where the pasture is rich it is fatal for their foals to have tasted their mothers' milk in the two days after birth; the name for the illness is biestings-fever. cheese is not made from species with teeth in both jaws, as their milk does not curdle. camel's milk is the thinnest and mares' milk the next thin; asses' milk is thickest, so that it is used as a substitute for rennet. asses' milk is actually thought to contribute something to the whiteness in women's skin; at all events domitius nero's wife poppaea used to drag five hundred she-asses with foals about with her everywhere and actually soaked her whole body in a bathtub with ass's milk, believing that it also smoothed out wrinkles. all milk is made thicker by fire and turned into whey by cold. cow's milk makes more cheese than goat's milk, almost as much again from the same quantity. animals with more than four dugs are not serviceable for cheese, and those with two are better.
