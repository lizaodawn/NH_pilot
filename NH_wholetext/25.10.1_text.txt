the first plant to be discovered was the peony, which still retains the name of the discoverer; it is called by some pentorobon, by others glycyside, for an added difficulty in botany is the variety of names given to the same plant in different districts. it grows on shaded mountains, having a stem among the leaves about four fingers high, which bears on its top four or five growths like almonds, in them being a large amount of seed, red and black. this plant also prevents the mocking delusions that the fauns bring on us in our sleep. they recommend us to uproot it at night-time, because the woodpecker of mars, should he see the act, will attack the eyes in its defence.
