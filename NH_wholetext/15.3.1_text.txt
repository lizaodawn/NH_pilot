it is not the same with olive-oil as with wine — age gives it an unpleasant flavour, and at the end of a year it is already old. herein, if one chooses to understand it, nature shows her forethought, inasmuch as there is no necessity to use up wine, which is produced for the purpose of intoxication — rather indeed the attractive over-ripeness which it acquires with age tempts us to keep it; but she did not desire us to be sparing in the use of oil, she has made it universal even among common people because of the necessity of using it quickly. in the matter of this blessing also italy has won the highest rank of all the world, particularly in the district of venafrum and the part of it which produces the licinian oil, which causes the licinian olive to be exceptionally famous. it is unguents that have given it this eminence, because its scent is so well adapted to them, but it has also been awarded to it by the palate with its more delicate judgement. moreover no bird will touch the berries of the licinian olive. the remainder of the competition is maintained between the territory of istria and that of baetica on equal terms, while for the rest the provinces have an approximately equal rank, with the exception of africa, whose soil is adapted for grain. this territory nature has yielded entirely to the corn-goddess, having all but entirely grudged it oil and wine, and having given it a sufficiency of glory in its harvests. the remaining statements prevalent concerning the olive are full of error, which shall prove to be more prevalent in no other department of life.
