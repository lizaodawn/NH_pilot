the second rank belonged to the falernian district, and in it particularly to the estate of faustus in consequence of the care taken in its cultivation; but the reputation of this district also is passing out of vogue through the fault of paying more attention to quantity than to quality. the falernian district begins at the campanian bridge as you turn left to reach the colonia urbana of sulla lately attached to capua, and the faustus estate begins about four miles from the village of caedicium, which is about six miles from sinuessa. no other wine has a higher rank at the present day. it is the only wine that takes light when a flame is applied to it. it has three varieties, one dry, one sweet and one a light wine. some people distinguish three vintages as follows â€” caucinian growing on the tops of the hills, faustian half-way up them, and falernian at the bottom. it must also not be omitted that none of the grapes that produce the celebrated vintages are agreeable to eat.
