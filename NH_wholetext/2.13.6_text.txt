linked with this is the cause of the latitudes of the zodiac and of its obliquity. the stars we have mentioned travel through the zodiac, and the only habitable part of the earth is what lies beneath it â€” all the other parts towards the poles are frost-bound. only the planet venus goes two degrees outside the zodiac; this is understood to be the reason that causes some animals to be born even in the desert places of the world. the moon also wanders through the whole of its breadth, but without going at all outside it. the planet mercury diverges very widely from these, but without wandering over more than 6 of the 12 degrees of latitude of the zodiac, and these 6 not uniformly but two in the middle of the zodiac, four above it and two below it. then the sun travels unevenly in the middle of the zodiac between the two halves with a wavy serpentine course, the planet mars over 4 degrees in the middle, jupiter one in the middle and two above it, saturn two like the sun. this will be the principle of the latitudes of the planets when setting towards the south or rising towards the north. most people have supposed that with this system agrees also the third mentioned above, that of their rising from the earth to the sky, and that this ascent also is made simultaneously; but this is a mistake. to refute them it is necessary to develop an extremely abstruse argument that embraces all the causes mentioned.
