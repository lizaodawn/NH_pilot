the same charge in the case of pears is censured by the name of pride; this is a small pear, but ripens very quickly. of all the varieties of pear, however, the grustumian is the nicest. next to this are falernian pears, used for perry, as they contain such a large quantity of juice — this is called being 'milky' — and among these are some others of a very dark colour, given us by syria. the names of the remaining varieties are designated differently in various different localities; but pears that have advertised their producers by the accepted designations of rome are the decimian, and the offshoot from it called the sham decimian, the very long-stalked one called the dolabellian, the kind of pomponian called breast-shaped, the licerian, the sevian, and the turranian, a variety sprung from the sevian but differing in length of stalk, the favonian, a red pear a little larger than the 'proud' pear, the laterian and the anician, which comes when autumn is over and has an agreeably acid flavour. one pear is called the tiberian, which was a special favourite of the emperor tiberius; it is more coloured by the sun and grows to a larger size, but otherwise would be the same as the licerian. pears having the name of their place of origin are the amerian, the latest of all kinds, the picentine, the numantine, the alexandrian, the numidian, the greek, a variety of which is the tarentine, and the signine, which some people call the tile-pear from its colour, like the onyx-pear and the purple pear; while named from their scent are the myrrh-pear, the bay-leaf pear and the nard-pear; named from its season the barley-pear; from its long neck, the bottle-pear; and the coriolan and bruttian pears are so-called because of their connexion with certain races, and the gourd-pear and the sourish pear because of their juice. pears the reason for the names of which is uncertain are the barbarian, the variety of venus pear called the coloured venus, the royal pear called the squat pear because of its very short stalk, the patrician pear, and the vocimum, a green kind of an oblong shape. virgil has also mentioned a warden pear, which he gets from cato, who also specifies a 'seed-time pear' and a 'must-pear.'
