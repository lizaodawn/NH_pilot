we have said that there is a wild cucumber much smaller than the cultivated kind. from it is made the drug called elaterium by pressing the juice out of the seed. unless, to prepare it, the cucumber be cut open before it is ripe, the seed spurts out, even endangering the eyes. after being gathered, the cucumber is kept for one night and then cut open on the next day with a reed. the seed too is kept in ash to prevent the juice from running away. this when pressed out is received in rain water, where it falls to the bottom. then it is thickened in the sun, and made into lozenges for the great benefit of mankind, being good for dim vision, eye diseases and sores of the eyelids. it is said that if the roots of vines are touched by this juice the grapes are not attacked by birds. the root too when boiled in vinegar is used as ointment in cases of gout, and its juice cures toothache. dried and mixed with resin it heals impetigo, itch, what are called psora and lichen, parotid swellings and superficial abscesses; it restores the natural colour to scars, while the juice of the leaves mixed with vinegar and poured by drops into the ears is a remedy for deafness.
