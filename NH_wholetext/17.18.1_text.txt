we turn now to certain special properties of the shade of different trees. that of walnut is heavy, and even causes headache in man and injury to anything planted in its vicinity; and that of the pine-tree also kills grass; but both the pine and the walnut withstand wind, as also their projecting branches shield them like penthouses. very heavy raindrops fall from the pine oak and holm-oak, but none at all from the cypress, which throws a very small compact shadow around it; and fig-trees give only a light shadow, however much spread out, and consequently it is not necessary to make it a rule not to plant them between vines. elms give a gentle shade which actually promotes the growth of any plants that it falls on, although atticus holds the view that also the shade of elms is one of the most oppressive, nor do i doubt that it is so if they are allowed to shoot out into branches, although i do not think that the shade of the elm does any harm when the tree is kept within bounds. the shade of the plane also though dense is agreeable, as we may learn from the evidence of grass, which under no other tree covers the banks more luxuriantly. the poplar with its gaily quivering leaves gives no shade at all; the shade of the alder is dense but permits the growth of plants. the vine gives enough shade for itself, as its quivering foliage and constant tossing tempers the sunshine with shadow, while by the same means it affords shelter in a heavy shower of rain. nearly all trees of which the leaves have long stalks afford only light shade.
