hard-oaks also bear catkins: that is the name of a small round ball used in medicine for its caustic property. it also grows on the fir, the larch, the pitch-pine, the lime, nut-trees and the plane, lasting on in the winter after the leaves have fallen. it contains a kernel resembling the kernel of pine-cones; this grows in winter and opens out in spring. when the leaves have begun to grow, the whole ball falls off. such is the multiplicity of products in addition to the acorn that are borne by hard-oaks; but they also produce edible fungi and hog-mushrooms, the most recently discovered stimulants of the appetite, which grow round their roots; those of the common oak are the most esteemed, but those of the hard-oak and cypress and pine are harmful. hard-oaks also produce mistletoe, and honey as well according to hesiod, and it is an accepted fact that honey-dew falling from the sky, as we said, deposits itself on the leaves of no other tree in preference to the hard-oak; and it is well known that hard-oak wood when burnt produces a nitrous ash.
