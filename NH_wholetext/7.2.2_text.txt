but beyond the other scythian cannibals, in a certain large valley in the imavi (himalayas), there is a region called abarimon where are some people dwelling in forests who have their feet turned backward behind their legs, who run extremely fast and range abroad over the country with the wild animals. it is stated by baeton, alexander the great's route-surveyor on his journeys, that these men are unable to breathe in another climate, and that consequently none of them could be brought to the neighbouring kings or had ever been brought to alexander. according to isogonus of nicaea the former cannibal tribes whom we stated to exist to the north, ten days' journey beyond the river borysthenes [dnieper], drink out of human skulls and use the scalps with the hair on as napkins hung round their necks. the same authority states that certain people in albania are born with keen grey eyes and are bald from childhood, and that they see better by night than in the daytime. he also says that the sauromatae, thirteen days' journey beyond the borysthenes, always take food once every two days.
