up to this point there is agreement as to which stones are supreme, the question having been largely settled by a decree of our women-councillors of state. there is less certainty regarding the stones about which men too pass judgement. in the case of men, it is an individual's caprice that sets a value upon an individual stone, and, above all, the rivalry that ensues. a case in point is that of the emperor claudius, when he took to wearing a 'smaragdus' or a sardonyx. but according to demostratus, the first roman to adopt a sardonyx was the elder africanus, and hence arose the esteem which this gemstone enjoys at rome. and so it is to this stone that i shall award the next place after the opal.
