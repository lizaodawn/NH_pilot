we have said that the umbilicus must be drawn at the middle of the line. let another line run transversely through the middle of the umbilicus; this line will run due east and west, and a path that cuts across the land on this line will be called the 'decuman'. then two other lines must be drawn obliquely to form an x, so as to run down from the right and left of the northern point to the left and right of the southern point. all these lines must run through the same umbilicus, and they must all be equal and the spaces between all of them must be equal. this system will have to be worked out once in each plot of land, or, if you mean to employ it frequently, a wooden model of it may be made consisting of rods of equal length fitted into a small but circular drum. under the method i am explaining help must be afforded to the understanding even of persons unacquainted with the subject: the rule is to examine the position of the sun at noon, as that is always the same, whereas the sunrise is at a different point in the sky every day from where it was yesterday, so nobody must suppose that the right plan is to take a line on sunrise.
