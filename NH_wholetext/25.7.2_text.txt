myself am amazed that the greeks have described even harmful plants, and not the poisonous ones only, since the state of human life is such that death is frequently a harbour of refuge even for the most excellent of men, marcus varro relating that the roman knight servius clodius, owing to the severe pain of gout, was forced to rub his legs all over with a poison, after which that part of his body was as free from sensation as it was from pain. but what excuse was there to point out the means of deranging the mind, of causing abortion, and of many similar crimes. i personally do not mention abortives, nor even love-philtres, remembering as i do that the famous general lucullus was killed by a love-philtre, nor yet any other unholy magic, unless it be by way of warning or denunciation, especially as i have utterly condemned all faith in such practices. enough pains, and more than enough, will have been taken if i point out plants healthful to life and discovered in order to preserve it.
