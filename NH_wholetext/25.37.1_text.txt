according to tradition nymphaea was born of a nymph who died of jealousy about hercules — for this reason some call it heracleon, others rhopalon because its root is like a club — and therefore those who have taken it in drink for twelve days are incapable of intercourse and procreation. the most valued kind grows in the district of orchomenos and at marathon. the boeotians call it mallon and eat the seed. it grows in watery places, with large leaves on the top of the water and others growing out of the root; the flowers are like the lily, and when the blossom is finished a head forms like that of the poppy; the stem is smooth. in autumn is cut the root, which is dark, and is dried in the sun. it reduces the spleen. there is another kind of nymphaea growing in the river penius in thessaly. it has a white root, and a yellow head of the size of a rose.
