what is called the unfilial plant is of a hoary white, in appearance like rosemary, clothed with leaves like a thyrsus and terminating in a head, from which sprout up little branches that also terminate each in a little head of its own. this is why the plant has been called unfilial, because the children out-top their parent. others have thought that it has been so named rather because no animal touches it. crushed between two stones this plant gives out an effervescing juice, which added to milk and wine is a sovereign remedy for pansies. attributed to it is this wonderful property; that they who have tasted it are never attacked by quinsy. accordingly, they say, it is also given to pigs, and those refusing to swallow the medicine are cut off by that complaint. there are some who think that a little of it is woven into birds' nests, and that this is why chicks are not choked by gulping their food too greedily.
