a plant too, called erinos by the greeks, must be described here because of the kinship of its name. it is a span high, and generally has five small stalks; it resembles basil, with a white flower and small black seed. pounded and added to attic honey this seed cures fluxes of the eyes, the proportions being two cyathi to four drachmae of attic honey. when broken this plant distils much sweet milk, which with the addition of a little soda is very beneficial for earaches. the leaves are an antidote to poisons.
