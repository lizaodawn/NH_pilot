the best barley is the whitest. the juice from a rainwater decoction is worked up into lozenges to be used as suppositories for ulcerations of the intestines and of the uterus. barley ash is applied to bums, to flesh that comes away from the bones, for eruptions of phlegm and for bites of the shrewmouse. the same added to honey and a sprinkling of salt makes the teeth white and the breath smell sweet. it is said that those who use barley bread never suffer from gout in the feet. they also say that, if a man, taking nine grains of barley, trace three times with each of them a circle round a boil, using the left hand, and then throw all the grains into the fire, the boil heals at once. there is also a plant, called phoenicea by the greeks and mouse barley by our countrymen. this pounded and taken in wine is an excellent emmenagogue.
