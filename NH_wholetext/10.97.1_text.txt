the question of sleep does not involve any obscure conjecture. it is clear that among land animals all those that close the eyes sleep. that also water animals sleep at all events a little is held even by those who doubt about the other kinds; they do not infer this from the eyes, as these creatures have no eyelids, but merely by their quietness: they are seen reposing as if sunk in slumber, and only moving their tails, and waking up in alarm at any disturbance. it is affirmed with more confidence about tunny-fish, because they sleep close to banks or rocks; while flatfish sleep in shallow water, so that they are often taken out by hand. dolphins and whales, in fact, are heard actually snoring. that insects also sleep is shown by their silence, and by their not even being roused by having lights brought near them.
