my proposed task of discussing wonderful plants suggests that i also say a few words about those that are magical. for what plants are more wonderful than they? these were first brought to the notice of our part of the world by pythagoras and democritus, who followed as their authority the magi. pythagoras declares that water is congealed by the plants coracesia and calicia; but i find no mention of them in other authorities, nor does pythagoras tell us anything else about them.
