seris also, itself very similar to lettuce, is of two kinds. the wild is the better; it is dark and grows in summer, while the winter variety, which is whiter, is not so good. each is bitter, and very beneficial to the stomach, especially to one troubled by a humour. they are cooling when taken with vinegar in food, and when applied as liniment; they disperse other humours besides those in the stomach. with pearl-barley the roots of the wild variety are taken in a draught to benefit the stomach; for heartburn they are applied above the left breast; prepared with vinegar all these are useful for gout, for spitting of blood, and likewise for fluxes of sperm, a dose to be taken on alternate days. petronius diodotus, who wrote a medical herbal, gives many arguments condemning seris altogether, but the opinion of all others is against him.
