galatia and the adjoining nations. on this occasion also it seems that we ought to speak of galatia, which lies above phrygia, and includes the greater part of the territory taken from that province, as also its former capital, gordium. the gauls who have settled in these parts, are called the tolistobogii, the voturi, and the ambitouti; those who dwell in maeonia and paphlagonia are called the trocmi. cappadocia stretches along to the north-east of galatia, its most fertile parts being possessed by the tectosages and the teutobodiaci. these are the nations by which those parts are occupied; and they are divided into peoples and tetrarchies, 195 in number. its towns are, among the tectosages, ancyra; among the trocmi, tavium; and, among the tolistobogi, pessinus. besides the above, the best known among the peoples of this region are the actalenses, the arasenses, the comenses, the didienses, the hierorenses, the lystreni, the neapolitani, the oeandenses, the seleucenses, the sebasteni, the timoniacenses, and the thebaseni. galatia also touches upon carbalia in pamphylia, and the milyae, about baris; also upon cyllanticum and oroandicum, a district of pisidia, and obizene, a part of lycaonia. besides those already mentioned, its rivers are the sangarius and the gallus, from which last the priests of the mother of the gods have taken their name.
