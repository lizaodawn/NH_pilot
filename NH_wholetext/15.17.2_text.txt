pears have a more tapering shape than apples. the late kinds among them hang on the mother tree till winter and ripen with the frost â€” the greek pear, the bottle pear, the bay-leaf pear; as also among apples do the amerian and scaudian varieties. pears are put in storage like grapes, and in as many different ways, and are the only fruit kept in casks except plums. of all the apple kind pears have the quality of wines, and like wine they are avoided by doctors in the treatment of the sick. boiled in wine and water they make a sort of jam, as does no other fruit except the quince and the sparrow-apple.
