the sinews starting from the heart, and in the ox actually wrapped round the heart, have a similar nature and explanation, being in all animals attached to the slippery bones and binding together the links of the bodily frame called joints, in some cases by coming between them, in others by surrounding them and in others by passing from one to another, being at one point rounded and at another flattened as the conformation of the joint requires in each case. the sinews also do not join again if cut, and, what is surprising, though extremely painful if wounded cause no pain at all if cut through. some animals, for instance fishes, have no sinews, as they are held together by their arteries; although the soft species of the fish genus lack arteries as well. where there are sinews, the inner ones contract the limbs and the ones on the surface reverse the movement.
