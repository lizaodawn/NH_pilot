now i will turn to those ills that threaten the whole body. the magi say that the gall of a black male dog, if a house is fumigated or purified with it, acts as a talisman protecting all of it from sorcerers' potions; it is the same if the inner walls are sprinkled with the dog's blood or his genital organ is buried under the threshold of the front door. those would wonder less at this who know how highly the magi extol that very loathsome animal the tick, on the ground that it is the only creature that has no vent for its gorging, nor yet any end save at death, living longer if it starves; they tell us that so it lasts for seven days, but if they eat to satiety they burst in a shorter time. they add that a tick from the left ear of a dog, worn as an amulet, relieves all pains. they also consider the tick a prognostication of life or death, for if the patient at the beginning of his illness makes reply when he who has brought in with him a tick, standing at his feet inquires about the illness, there is sure hope of recovery; should no reply be made the patient will die. they add that the tick must be taken from the left ear of a dog that is completely black all over. nigidius has left it in writing that dogs run away for a whole day from the sight of one who has caught a tick on a pig. again, the magi tell us that sprinkling with mole's blood restores to their senses the delirious, while those who are haunted by night ghosts and goblins are freed from their terrors if tongue, eyes, gall, and intestines of a python are boiled down in wine and oil, cooled by night in the open air, and used as embrocation night and morning.
