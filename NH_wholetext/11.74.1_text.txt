the liver also contains the gall-bladder, but not all animals possess one. at chalcis in euboea the cattle have none, while at naxos they have a very large double one, so that both facts seem portentous to a stranger. horses, mules, asses, stags, wild goats, boars, camels and dolphins have not got one; some mice have. among human beings few lack one; those who do are exceptionally strong in health and long-lived. some think that the horse has a gall-bladder not indeed in the liver but in the belly, and that the stag has one in the tail or in the bowels, and that consequently they have such a bitter flavour that dogs will not touch them. but as a matter of fact it is only excrement, and because of this the substance of this part also contains the worst portion of the blood. unquestionably only sanguineous animals possess a liver. the liver receives the blood from the heart with which it is connected, and passes it into the veins.
