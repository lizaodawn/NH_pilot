division of the earth into parallels and shadows of equal length. to the above we shall add even another instance of ingenious discovery by the greeks, and indeed of the most minute skilfulness; that so nothing may be wanting to our investigation of the geographical divisions of the earth, and the various countries thereof which have been pointed out; that it may be the better understood, too, what affinity, or relationship as it were, exists between one region and another, in respect to the length of their days and nights, and in which of them the shadows are of equal length, and the distance from the pole is the same. i shall therefore give these particulars as well, and shall state the divisions of the whole earth in accordance with the various sections of the heavens. the lines or segments which divide the world are many in number; by our people they are known as "circuli" or circles, by the greeks they are called "paralleli" or parallels.
