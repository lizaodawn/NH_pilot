but the first person to institute the custom of privately dedicating the shields with portraits in a temple or public place, i find, was appius claudius, the consul with publius servilius in the 259th year of the city. he set up his ancestors in the temple of bellona, and desired them to be in full view on an elevated spot, and the inscriptions stating their honours to be read. this is a seemly device, especially if miniature likenesses of a swarm of children at the sides display a sort of brood of nestlings; shields of this description everybody views with pleasure and approval.
