where exactly storks come from or where they go to has not hitherto been ascertained. there is no doubt that they come from a distance, in the same manner as do cranes, the former being winter visitors and the latter arriving in summer. when about to depart they assemble at fixed places, and forming a company, so as to prevent any of their class being left behind (unless one captured and in slavery), they withdraw as if at a date fixed in advance by law. no one has seen a band of storks departing, although it is quite clear that they are going to depart, nor do we see them arrive, but only see that they have arrived; both arrival and departure take place in the night-time, and although they fly to and fro across the country, it is thought that they have never arrived anywhere except by night. there is a place in asia called snakesdorp with a wide expanse of plains where cranes meet in assembly to hold a palaver, and the one that arrives last they set upon with their claws, and so they depart; it. has been noticed that they have not frequently been seen there after the first fortnight of august. some persons declare that storks have no tongue. they are held in such high esteem for destroying snakes that in thessaly to kill them was a capital crime, for which the legal penalty was the same as for homicide.
