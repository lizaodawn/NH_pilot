cough is cured by wolf's liver in warmed wine, by bear's gall mixed with honey, by the tips of the horns of ox or cow reduced to ash, by the saliva of a horse taken for three days (they say that the horse dies), by a deer's lung dried in smoke with the gullet, then pounded in honey and taken daily as an electuary, the species of deer more efficacious for this purpose being the subulo. spitting of blood is cured by the ash of deer's horn, and by hare's rennet, the dose being one third part of a denarius, with samian earth and myrtle wine. hare's dung reduced to ash and taken in wine in the evening cures night coughs, and inhaling the smoke of burning hare's fur brings up difficult expectorations. purulent ulceration of the chest or lungs, and foul breath from the lungs, are very effectively relieved by butter boiled with an equal measure of attic honey until it turns red, the dose being a spoonful taken in the morning; some instead of honey have preferred to add larch resin. for spitting of blood it is said to be beneficial to drink ox or cow blood, a moderate amount taken in vinegar. but to trust recommendations of bull's blood is hazardous; bull glue, however, in three-oboli doses is taken with warm water for chronic spitting of blood.
