the fruit next to these in size is the one that we call the quince and the greeks cydoneum, which was introduced from the island of crete. this fruit drags down the boughs in a curve and checks the growth of the parent tree. there are several kinds of quinces: the 'golden apple' is cleft with incisions and has a colour verging on gold, a brighter tinge of which gives a name to our native quince, and has an exquisite scent. the naples quince is also highly esteemed. the smaller variety of the same kind, the sparrow-apple, gives out a rather pungent smell, and ripens late, whereas the must-quince ripens very early. grafting the ordinary quince on the sparrow-apple has produced a special kind, the mulvian quince, which is the only one of the quinces that is eaten even raw; these at the present day are kept shut up in gentlemen's reception-rooms, and are placed on the statues that share our nights with us. there is also a small wild quince, the scent of which is the most powerful next to that of the sparrow-apple and which grows in the hedges.
