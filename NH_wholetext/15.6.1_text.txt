we will now state the rules given by cato in respect of olives. in a warm and rich soil he recommends planting the larger radius olive, the sallentine, the orchites, the posia, the sergian, the corninian and the wax-white, and he adds with remarkable wisdom that the one among these pronounced in the particular localities to be the best should be used; while he recommends planting the licinian olive in a cold and thin soil, for the reason that rich or warm earth ruins its oil and the tree gets exhausted by its mere fertility, and moreover is attacked by moss and red rust. he advises that olive-yards should be in a position exposed to the sun and facing west, and he does not approve of any other arrangement. he says that the best way of preserving orchites and posia olives is either to put them in brine when they are green or to crush them and store them in mastic oil; the best olive-oil is made from the bitterest olive obtainable; for the rest the olives should be collected off the ground as soon as possible, and washed if they are dirty; it is enough to leave them to dry for three days, and if the weather is cold and frosty they must be pressed on the fourth day, and when pressed they should be sprinkled with salt. olives kept on a boarded floor lose oil and it deteriorates in quality, and the same happens if the oil is left on the lees and the grounds — these are the flesh of the olive and produce the dregs; consequently it should be ladled several times a day, and moreover this must be done with a shell and into leaden caldrons, as copper spoils it. all these operations, he says, must be carried on with presses that have been heated and tightly closed, admitting as little air as possible, and therefore also no wood should be cut there (and consequently the most suitable fire is made with the stones of the olives themselves); the oil must be poured out of the caldrons into vats, so as to leave behind the grounds and the lees: for this purpose the vessels must be changed fairly frequently and the osier baskets wiped with a sponge, so that so far as possible complete cleanliness may be produced. it was a later discovery, he says, to wash the olives in absolutely boiling water, and at once put them whole into the press — for that method crushes out the lees — and then to crush them in oil-mills and put them under the press a second time. people do not approve of pressing more than a hundred pecks of olives at a time: this is called a 'batch,' and what is squeezed out first after the millstone is called the 'flower.' it is a fair amount for three batches to be pressed in twenty-four hours by gangs of four men using a double holder.
