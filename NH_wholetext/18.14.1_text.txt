barley is the oldest among human foods, as is proved by the athenian ceremony recorded by menander, and by the name given to gladiators, who used to be called 'barley-men'. also the greeks prefer it to any other grain for porridge. there are several ways of making barley porridge: the greeks soak some barley in water and then leave it for a night to dry, and next day dry it by the fire and then grind it in a mill. some after roasting it more thoroughly sprinkle it again with a small amount of water and dry it before milling; others however shake the young barley out of the ears while green, clean it and while it is wet pound it in a mortar, and wash it of husk in baskets and then dry it in the sun and again pound it, clean it and grind it. but whatever kind of barley is used, when it has been got ready, in the mill they mix in three pounds of flax seed, half a pound of coriander seed, and an eighth of a pint of salt, previously roasting them all. those who want to keep it for some time in store put it away in new earthenware jars with fine flour and its own bran. italians bake it without steeping it in water and grind it into fine meal, with the addition of the same ingredients and millet as well.
