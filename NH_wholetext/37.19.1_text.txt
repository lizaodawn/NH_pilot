among the 'smaragdi' we include also a gem that comes from persia known as the 'tanos,' which is of an ugly shade of green and is full of flaws within and another from cyprus, the 'chalcosmaragdna,' or 'copper smaragdus,' which is clouded by veins resembling copper. theophrastus records that in egyptian records are to be found statements to the effect that to one of the kings a king of babylon once sent as a gift a 'smaragdus' measuring four cubits in length and three in breadth; and that there existed in egypt in a temple of jupiter an obelisk made of four 'smaragdi' and measuring forty cubits in height and four cubits in breadth at one extremity and two at the other. he states, moreover, that at the time when he was writing there existed in the temple of hercules at tyre a large square pillar of 'smaragdus,' unless this was rather to be regarded as a 'false smaragdus'; for, according to him, this is another variety that is found.
