akin to the reed is a plant growing in egypt, the papyrus, which, when it has been dried, is especially useful for expanding and drying fistulas, and, by swelling, for opening them to admit medicaments. the paper made from it is, when burnt, one of the caustic remedies. its ash taken in wine induces sleep. the plant itself applied with water cures callosities.
