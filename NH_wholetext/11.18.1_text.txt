moreover they supply private and public portents when a cluster of them hangs suspended in houses and temples, portents that have often been expiated by great events. they alighted on the mouth of plato even when he was still an infant, portending the charm of that matchless eloquence; and they alighted in the camp of general drusus on the occasion of the very successful battle of arbalo - as there are certainly exceptions to the interpretation of the augurs, who invariably think this a direful portent. the capture of the leader holds up the whole body, and when they have lost him they separate and migrate to other lords; in any case they are unable to be without a king. but when the kings have become too numerous they reluctantly destroy them, and by preference they destroy their homes while they are being born. if a supply of honey is despaired of, then they even drive away the drones. nevertheless i see that there is a doubt about these also, and that some persons think them to form a breed of their own, like the robber-bees, the largest in size among the drones but black and with a broad belly, which have this designation because they steal and devour the honey. it is certain that the drones are killed by the bees; at all events they do not have a king in the same way as the other bees do; but whether they are born without a sting is a doubtful point.
