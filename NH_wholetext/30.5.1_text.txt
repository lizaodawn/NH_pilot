as osthanes said, there are several forms of magic; he professes to divine from water, globes, air, stars, lamps, basins and axes, and by many other methods, and besides to converse with ghosts and those in the underworld. all of these in our generation the emperor nero discovered to be lies and frauds. in fact his passion for the lyre and tragic song was no greater than his passion for magic; his elevation to the greatest height of human fortune aroused desire in the vicious depths of his mind; his greatest wish was to issue commands to the gods, and he could rise to no nobler ambition. no other of the arts ever had a more enthusiastic patron. every means were his to gratify his desire — wealth, strength, aptitude for learning — and what else did the world not allow! that the craft is a fraud there could be no greater or more indisputable proof than that nero abandoned it; but would that he had consulted about his suspicions the powers of hell and any other gods whatsoever, instead of entrusting these researches to pimps and harlots. of a surety no ceremony, outlandish and savage though the rites may be, would not have been gentler than nero's thoughts; more cruelly behaving than any did nero thus fill our rome with ghosts.
