the greeks tell the story that anaxagoras of clazomenae in the 2nd year [467 bc] of the 78th olympiad was enabled by his knowledge of astronomical literature to prophecy that in a certain number of days a rock would fall from the sun; and that this occurred in the daytime in the goat's river (aegospotami) district of thrace (the stone is still shown — it is of the size of a wagon-load and brown in colour), a comet also blazing in the nights at the time. if anyone believes in the fact of this prophecy, that involves his allowing that the divining powers of anaxagoras covered a greater marvel, and that our understanding of the physical universe is annihilated and everything thrown into confusion if it is believed either that the sun is itself a stone or ever had a stone inside it. but it will not be doubted that stones do frequently fall. a stone is worshipped for this reason even at the present day in the exercising ground at abydos — one of moderate size, it is true, but which the same anaxagoras is said to have prophesied as going to fall in the middle of the country. there is also one that is worshipped at cassandria, the place that has been given the name of potidaea, and where a colony was settled on account of this occurrence. i myself saw one that had recently come down in the territory of the vocontii.
