the reed likes an even moister soil than osiers do. it is planted by putting the bulb of the root, which others call the 'eye' in a hole nine inches deep, two feet six inches apart; and it renews itself of its own accord when an old reed-bed has been rooted up, a method that has been found to pay better than thinning out, as used to be done previously, because the roots get twisted up together and are hilled by their mutual inroads. the time to plant is before the eyes of the reeds swell up, which is before the first of march. it goes on growing till midwinter, and stops when it is beginning to get hard, which is the indication that it is ready for cutting; though it is thought that the reed also requires digging round as often as the vine does. it is also planted in a horizontal position, not buried deep in the ground, and as many shoots spring up as there are eyes. it is also grown by being planted out in a hole a foot deep, with two eyes buried so that the third knot is just touching the earth, and with the head bent down so as not to hold the dew. it is cut when the moon is on the wane. for propping vines a reed dried in smoke is more serviceable than one still green.
