we will begin with ostia, a colony founded by a king of rome, the town of laurentum, the grove of jupiter indiges, the river numicius, and ardea, founded by danae, the mother of perseus. next come the former site of aphrodisium, the colony of antium, the river and island called astura, the river nymphaeus, the clostra romana, and circeii, formerly an island, and, if we are to believe homer, surrounded by the open sea, though now by an extensive plain. the circumstances which we are enabled to publish on this subject for the information of the world are very remarkable. theophrastus, the first foreigner who treated of the affairs of rome with any degree of accuracy (for theopompus, before whose time no greek writer had made mention of us, only stated the fact that the city had been taken by the gauls, and clitarchus, the next after him, only spoke of the embassy that was sent by the romans to alexander) â€” theophrastus, i say, following something more than mere rumour, has given the circuit of the island of circeii as being eighty stadia, in the volume which he wrote during the archonship of nicodorus at athens, being the 440th year of our city. whatever land therefore has been annexed to that island beyond the circumference of about ten miles, has been added to italy since the year previously mentioned.
