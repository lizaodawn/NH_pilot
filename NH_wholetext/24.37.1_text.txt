the fruit of the willow before maturity develops a kind of cobweb, but if it be gathered earlier it is good for the spitting of blood. mixed with water, the ash from the burnt bark of the tips of the branches cures corns and callosities. it removes spots on the face, more thoroughly when mixed with willow juice. this juice, however, is of three kinds: one exudes like gum from the tree itself; the second flows from an incision, three fingers wide, made in the bark while the tree is in blossom. this sort is useful for clearing away humours that obstruct the eyes, also for thickening where that is necessary, for promoting urine and for draining outwards all gatherings. the third kind of juice is obtained by lopping off the branches, when it drips under the sickle. one, then, of these juices warmed in a pomegranate rind with rose oil is poured into the ears, or a local application is made of the boiled leaves beaten up with wax. for gout too it is most useful to foment the sinews with a decoction of the bark and leaves in wine. the blossom beaten up with the leaves removes scurf on the face. the leaves thoroughly pounded and taken in drink check over-lustful desire; too many doses produce absolute impotence. the seed of the black willow of ameria with an equal weight of litharge, applied after the bath, acts as a depilatory.
