a hippopotamus was exhibited at rome for the first time, together with five crocodiles, by marcus scaurus at the games which he gave when aedile; a temporary channel was made to hold them. the hippopotamus stands out as an actual master in one department of medicine; for when its unceasing voracity has caused it to overeat itself it comes ashore to reconnoitre places where rushes have recently been cut, and where it sees an extremely sharp stalk it squeezes its body down on to it and makes a wound in a certain vein in its leg, and by thus letting blood unburdens its body, which would otherwise be liable to disease, and plasters up the wound again with mud.
