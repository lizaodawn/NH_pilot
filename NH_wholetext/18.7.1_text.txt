the satisfactory plan is that the house shall not be inadequate to the farm nor the farm to the house, not as was done on adjacent estates by lucius lucullus and quintus scaevola, acting on opposite principles though at the same period, when scaevola's farmhouse would not hold the produce of his farm and lucullus's farm was not big enough for his house — a sort of extravagance that occasioned the censor's rebuke that there was less ground to plough than floor-space to sweep. the proper arrangement requires a certain amount of technical skill. quite recently gaius marius, who was seven times consul, built a country house in the district of misenum, but he relied on the skill he had acquired in planning the layout of a camp, so that even sulla the fortunate declared that all the others had been blind men in comparison with marius. it is agreed that a country house ought not to be put near a marsh nor with a river in front of it — although homer has stated with the greatest truth that in any case there are always unhealthy currents of air rising from a river before dawn. in hot localities the house should look north, in cold ones south and in temperate situations due east.
