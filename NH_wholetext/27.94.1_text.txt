periclymenon too is a plant which grows into a shrub, having after an interval two leaves which are whitish and soft. and at the top among the leaves is a seed which is hard, and difficult to pluck. the plant grows in cultivated fields and in hedges, climbing round supports of any kind. its seed is dried in the shade, pounded, and worked up into lozenges. these, dissolved in three cyathi of white wine, are given for thirty days to cure splenic affections, the spleen being reduced either by blood in the urine or through the bowels, as is plain immediately from the tenth day. the boiled leaves too are diuretic, and also beneficial to asthmatics; they aid delivery and bring away the afterbirth if taken in drink in a similar way.
