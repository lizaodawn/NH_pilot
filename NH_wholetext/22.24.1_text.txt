there is also another plant, which being like alkanet is called bastard alkanet, though some call it echis or doris or by many other names; it is more downy than the other and less fleshy, the leaves are thinner and more flabby. the root in oil does not give out a red juice, by which test it is distinguished from true alkanet. the leaves or seed taken in drink are a very sure antidote to snake bite. the leaves are applied to stings and bites, and their strong smell keeps snakes away. a draught too is made from the plant for affections of the spine. the magi recommend that a leaf of it should be gathered with the left hand, with a declaration for whom it is being taken, and used as an amulet for tertian fevers.
