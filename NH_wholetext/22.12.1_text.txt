one kind of caltrop grows in gardens, the other only in rivers. from both the juice is collected to make eye medicines, for it is of a cooling nature and therefore useful for inflammations and abscesses. mixed with honey it heals sores that break out of themselves, especially those in the mouth, and also sore tonsils. taken in drink it breaks up stone in the bladder. the thracians on the banks of the strymon feed their horses on the leaves of the caltrop, themselves living on the kernel, out of which they make a very pleasant bread, and one to bind the bowels. the root, if gathered in chastity and purity, disperses scrofulous sores; the seed used as an amulet soothes painful varicose veins; pounded, moreover, and sprinkled in water it kills fleas.
