the bite of a human being is considered to be a most serious one. it is treated with ear wax, and (let no one be surprised) this, if applied locally at once, is also good for the stings of scorpions and for the bites of serpents, being more efficacious if taken from the ears of the sufferer. hangnails too are said to be cured in this way; the bite of serpents by a human tooth ground to powder.
