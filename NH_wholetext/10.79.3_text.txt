geese mate in the water; they lay in spring, or if they mated in midwinter, after midsummer; they lay nearly 40 eggs, twice in a year if the hens turn the first brood out of the nest, otherwise sixteen eggs at the most and seven at the fewest. if somebody removes the eggs, they go on laying till they burst. they do not turn strange eggs out of the nest. it pays best to put nine or eleven eggs for them to sit on. the hens sit only 30 days at a time, or if the days are rather warm, 25. the touch of a nettle is fatal to goslings, and not less so is their greediness, sometimes owing to their excessive gorging and sometimes owing to their own violence, when they have caught hold of a root in their beak and in their repeated attempts to tear it off break their own necks before they succeed. a nettle-root put under their straw after they have lain in it is a cure for nettle-sting.
