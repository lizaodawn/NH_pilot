heavy rain also breeds caterpillars, noxious creatures that gnaw away the foliage of olives, and others the flower too, as at miletus, and leave the half-eaten tree shamefully disfigured. this pestilence is bred by damp sticky heat; and another one due to the same cause occurs if too keen a sun follows, and burns in the damage done by the damp and so alters its nature. there is in addition a malady peculiar to olives and vines, called cobweb, when the fruit gets wrapped up in a soft of webbing which stifles it. there are also certain currents of air which are specially blighting to olives, though they dry up other fruit as well. as to worm, in some trees even the fruits of themselves suffer from it â€” apples, pears, medlars and pomegranates; but in the case of the olive an attack of worm has a twofold result, inasmuch as if they breed under the skin they destroy the fruit, while if they have been in the actual stone, gnawing it away, they make the fruit larger. rain following the rising of arcturus prevents their breeding; and also if this rain is accompanied by a south wind it breeds worms in overripe olives as well, which are then particularly liable to fall off when ripening. this happens particularly with olives in damp localities, making them very unattractive even if they do not drop off. there is also a kind of gnat troublesome to some fruits, for instance acorns and figs, which appears to be bred from the sweet juice a secreted underneath the bark at that season; and indeed these trees are usually sickly.
