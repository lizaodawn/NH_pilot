many more facts can be produced about these mysteries of nature and the laws that she obeys - for example, in the case of the planet mars (whose course it is very difficult to observe) that it never makes its station with jupiter at an angle of 120, and very seldom with jupiter separated 60 (which amounts to 1/6th of the celestial sphere), and never makes its rises simultaneously with jupiter except in two signs only, cancer and leo, whereas the planet mercury rarely makes its evening rises in pisces, and most frequently in virgo, its morning rises in libra, and also its morning rises in aquarius, very rarely in leo; it does not make its return in taurus and in gemini, and not below the 25th degree in cancer; gemini is the only sign in which the moon makes conjunction with the sun twice, sagittarius the only one in which she does not meet him at all, aries the only one in which the old moon and the new moon are visible on the same day or night (and this too it has happened to few mortals to see, hence lynceus's reputation for keen sight); the longest period of invisibility for the planets saturn and mars is 170 days, for jupiter 36 days; the shortest periods for all these are 10 days less; venus's period is 69 days or at shortest 52, mercury's 13 or at longest 17.
