it follows that the points of the arcs highest above the centre of the earth are: in the case of saturn in scorpio, in that of jupiter in virgo, of mars in leo, of the sun in the twins, of venus in the archer, of mercury in capricorn, of the moon in the bull, at the middle of each, and the points lowest and nearest to the centre of the earth are opposite. the result of this is that they appear to move slower and to be smaller when they are travelling at the highest point of their circuit, but to be larger and travel faster when they have come nearer to the earth, not because they actually accelerate or reduce their natural motions, which are fixed and individual to them, but because lines drawn from the top of the arc to the centre necessarily converge like the spokes of a wheel, and the same motion at one time is perceived as faster and at another slower according to its distance from the centre.
