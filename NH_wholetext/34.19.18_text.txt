in mentioning statues - there is also one we must not pass over in spite of the sculptor's not being known - the figure, next to the rostra, of heracles in the tunic, the only one in rome that shows him in that dress; the countenance is stern and the statue expresses the feeling of the final agony of the tunic. on this statue there are three inscriptions, one stating that it had been part of the booty taken by the general lucius lucullus, and another saying that it was dedicated, in pursuance of a decree of the senate, by lucullus's son while still a ward, and the third, that titus septimius sabinus as curule aedile had caused it to be restored to the public from private ownership. so many were the rivalries connected with this statue and so highly was it valued.
