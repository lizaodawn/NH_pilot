among these and the fruit-bearing trees a place is given to the elm, because of its timber and the friendship between it and the vine. the greeks are acquainted with two kinds of elm: the mountain elm which makes the larger growth, and the elm of the plains which grows like a shrub. italy gives the name of atinian elm to a very lofty kind (and among these values highest the dry variety, which will not grow in damp places); a second kind it calls the gallic elm, a third, which has thicker foliage and more leaves growing from the same stalk, the italian elm, and a fourth, the wild elm. the atinian elm does not bear samara - that is the name for elm seed - and all the elms are grown from shoots of the roots, but the other kinds also from seed.
