man is the only species in which the male has teats; with the rest of the animals there are only the marks of teats. but with the females also only those have teats on the breast that are able to lift their offspring up to them. no oviparous species has teats; and only the viviparous have milk. among flying species only the bat has milk, as i think the story about screech-owls, that they drop milk from their teats into the mouths of babies, is a fabrication. it is an acknowledged fact that even in old days the screech-owl was one of the creatures under a curse, but what particular bird is meant i believe to be uncertain.
