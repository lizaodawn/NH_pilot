a cursory description can suffice for the rest of the plants. the best time for sowing basil is said to be at the feast of pales, and some say in autumn also, advising that when it is sown for winter the seed should be moistened with vinegar. also rocket and cress can be grown very easily either in summer or in winter. rocket particularly thinks nothing of cold. its properties are quite different from those of lettuce, and it acts as an aphrodisiac; consequently it is usually blended with lettuce in a salad, so that the excessive chilliness of the lettuce may be tempered and counterbalanced by being mingled with an equal amount of heat. cress has got its latin name from the pain that it gives to the nostrils, and owing to this the sense of vigorousness has attached itself to that word in the current expression as denoting a stimulant. it is said to grow to a remarkably large size in arabia.
