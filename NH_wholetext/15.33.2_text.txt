smell also contains its own marvels. apples have a pungent scent, peaches a weak one, and sweet fruits none at all; for even sweet wine has no smell, although thin wine has more aroma, and wines of that class become fit for use much sooner than those with more body. fruits with a scent are not likewise agreeable to the palate, as scent and flavour do not go together - so that citrons have a very penetrating smell and a very rough taste, and in some degree that is the case with quinces also; and figs have no smell.
