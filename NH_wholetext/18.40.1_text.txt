the name for secale in the subalpine district of the taurini is asia; it is a very poor food and only serves to avert starvation; its stalk carries a large head but is a thin straw; it is of a dark sombre colour, and exceptionally heavy. wheat is mixed in with this to mitigate its bitter taste, and all the same, it is very unacceptable to the stomach even so. it grows in any sort of soil with a hundred-fold yield, and serves of itself to enrich the land.
