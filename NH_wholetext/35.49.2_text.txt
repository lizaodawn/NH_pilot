three kinds of bricks are made: the 'didoron,' the one employed by us, eighteen inches long and a foot wide, second the 'tetradoron' and third the 'pentadoron,' doron being an old greek word meaning the palm of the hand from which comes doron, meaning a gift, because a gift was given by the hand. consequently the bricks get their names from four or five palms' length as the case may be. their breadth is in all cases the same. in greece the smaller kind is used for private structures and the larger in public buildings. at pitana in asia minor as also in the city states of maxima and callet in further spain bricks are made which when dried will not sink in water, being made of pumice-like earth, which is an extremely useful material when it is capable of being worked. the greeks preferred brick walls except in places permitting of a stone structure, as brick walls last for ever if built exactly perpendicular. consequently that was how they built both public works and kings' palaces â€” the wall at athens that faces towards mount hymettus, at patrae the shrines of zeus and of heracles (although the columns and architraves with which they surrounded these were of stone), and the royal palace of attalus at tralles and likewise the palace of croesus at sardis, which they converted into a house of elders, and that of mausolus at halicarnassus, buildings still standing. murena and varro in their aedileship had some plaster work on brick walls at sparta cut away, and because of the excellence of its painting had it enclosed in wooden frames and brought to rome to decorate the comitium. it was in itself a wonderful piece of work, yet its transfer caused even more admiration. in italy also there is a brick wall at arezzo and at mevania. structures of this sort are not erected in rome, because an eighteen inch wall will only carry a single storey, and there is a regulation forbidding any partition exceeding that thickness: nor does the system used for party-walls permit of it.
