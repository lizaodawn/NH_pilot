the dross of lead is also utilized. the best is that which approximates in colour most closely to yellow, containing no remnants of lead or sulphur, and does not look earthy. this is broken up into small fragments and washed in mortars till the water assumes a yellow colour, and poured off into a clean vessel, and the process is repeated several times till the most valuable part settles as a sediment at the bottom. lead dross has the same effects as lead, but to a more active degree. this suggests a remark on the marvellous efficacy of human experiment, which has not left even the dregs of substances and the foulest refuse untested in such numerous ways!
