we will add to these some animals mentioned by ovid, which are found in no other writer but which are perhaps native to the black sea where he began that unfinished book in the last days of his life: horned ray, 'cercyrus' which lives amongst rocks, 'orphus,' and red 'errthinus,' 'iulus,' tinted sea-breams and gilt-head of golden colour; and, besides these, perch, 'tragus,' black-tail with pretty tail, 'epodes' of the flat kind. besides these remarkable kinds of fishes he records: that the sea-perch conceives of herself, that the 'glaucus' never appears in summer; and he mentions the pilot-fish as always accompanying ships on their course, and the 'chronlis' which makes its nest in the waves. he says that the 'helops' is unknown to our waters: from which it is clear that those who have believed that acipenser (sturgeon) is the same are in error. many people have given the first prize for taste to the helops among all fish.
