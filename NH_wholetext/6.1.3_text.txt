the length of the borders of the euxine from the bosporus to the lake maeotis has been reckoned by some writers at fourteen hundred and thirty-eight miles; eratosthenes, however, says that it is one hundred less. according to agrippa, the distance from chalcedon to the phasis is one thousand miles, and from that river to the cimmerian bosporus three hundred and sixty. we will here give in a general form the distances as they have been ascertained in our own times; for our arms have even penetrated to the very mouth of the cimmerian straits.
