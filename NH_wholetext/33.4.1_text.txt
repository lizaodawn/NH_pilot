the worst crime against man's life was committed by the person who first put gold on his fingers, though it is not recorded who did this, for i deem the whole story of prometheus mythical, although antiquity assigned to him also an iron ring, and intended this to be understood as a fetter, not an ornament. as for the story of midas's ring, which when turned round made its wearer invisible, who would not admit this to be more mythical still? it was the hand and what is more the left a hand, that first won for gold such high esteem; not indeed a roman hand, whose custom it was to wear an iron ring as an emblem of warlike valour.
