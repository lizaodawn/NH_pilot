the value of honey in popular esteem would be no less than that of laser, were not honey produced everywhere. granted that nature herself created the one, she yet created an insect, as i have said, to make the other for countless uses, if we try to reckon the compounds of which it is an ingredient. first there is bee-glue in the hives, about which i have spoken; it extracts stings and all substances embedded in the flesh, reduces swellings, softens indurations, soothes pains of the sinews, and heals sores when it seems hopeless for them to mend. honey itself has a nature that prevents a body from decaying, with a pleasant and not harsh taste, essentially different from salt, very good for the throat, tonsils, quinsy, all complaints of the mouth, and for tongues parched by fever; moreover, the decoction is excellent for pneumonia and pleurisy, while for wounds, snake bites, poisons, fungi and paralysis, it is prescribed in honey wine, although that has peculiar virtues of its own. honey and rose oil are injected into the ears, and kill nits and offensive parasites on the head. honey is improved by being skimmed, but it causes flatulence, biliousness and nausea; some think it of itself injurious to the eyes, though there are others on the other hand who recommend that ulcers in the corners be touched with honey. how honey is produced, the different kinds of it, the countries famous for it and the signs of its value, i discussed when treating of the nature of bees and again when i came to flowers, since the plan of my work necessitated the division of things that have to be afterwards combined again by those who wish to learn thoroughly the works of nature.
