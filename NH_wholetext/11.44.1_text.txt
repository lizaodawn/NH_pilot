now let our investigation treat of the various parts of bodies besides the ones already mentioned, taking limb by limb. all creatures that have blood have a head. on the head a few kinds, and these only birds, have crests, of different sorts it is true — with the phoenix it is a row of feathers spreading out from the middle of the head in a different direction, peacocks have bushy tufts, the bird of stymphalus a crest, the pheasant little horns, as moreover has the small bird that was formerly named from this peculiarity the crested lark and subsequently was called by the gallic word alauda and gave that name also to the legion so entitled. we have also said which bird has been endowed by nature with a folding crest. nature has also bestowed a crest that slopes backwards from the beak down the middle of the neck on the coot species, and also a tufted crest on mars's woodpecker and on the balearic crane, but she has given the most distinguished decoration to the poultry-cock — its fleshy, notched comb; and this cannot rightly be described as flesh or gristle or hard skin, but is a gift peculiar to it: for no one can be found who has ever seen serpents' crests.
