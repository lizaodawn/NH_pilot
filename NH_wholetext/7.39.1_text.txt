the highest price hitherto paid, so far as i have ascertained, for a person born in slavery was when attius of pisaurum was selling a skilled linguist named daphnis and marcus scaurus, head of the state, bid 700,000 sesterces. this has been exceeded, and considerably, in our own time by actors when buying their own freedom by means of their earnings, inasmuch as already in the time of our ancestors the actor roscius is said to have earned 500,000 sesterces a year, - unless anybody expects a mention in this place of the commissary in the armenian war carried on not long ago for tiridates, whom nero liberated for 13,000,000 sesterces. but this was the price paid for a war, not for an individual, just as in truth when clutorius priscus bought one of sejanus's eunuchs paezon for 50,000,000, this was the price of lust and not of beauty. but clutorius got away with this outrageous affair during a period of national mourning, as nobody had time to show him up.
