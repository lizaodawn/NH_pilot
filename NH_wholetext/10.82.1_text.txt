on the other hand among land animals, the snake is oviparous; we have not yet described this species. snakes mate by embracing, intertwining so closely that they could be taken to be a single animal with two heads. the male viper inserts its head into the female viper's mouth, and the female is so enraptured with pleasure that she gnaws it off. the viper is the only land animal that bears eggs inside it; they are of one colour and soft like fishes' roe. after two days she hatches the young inside her uterus, and then bears them at the rate of one a day, to the number of about twenty; the consequence is that the remaining ones get so tired of the delay that they burst open their mother's sides, so committing matricide. all the other kinds of snakes incubate their eggs in a clutch on the ground, and hatch out the young in the following year. crocodiles take turns to incubate, male and female. but let us give an account of the mode of reproduction of the remaining land animals as well.
