the 'trichrus,' or 'three-coloured' stone, which comes from africa, is black, but gives off streaks of three colours, black at the base, blood-red in the middle and yellow at the top. the 'thelyrrhizos,' or 'lady root,' is ashen or red in colour and is distinguished by its white base. the 'thelycardios,' or 'lady heart,' which displays the colour of a heart, gives great pleasure to the persians, among whom it is found. their name for it is 'mucul.' the 'thracia,' or 'thracian gem,' occurs in three varieties, emerald-green or alternatively paler, while the third has blood-red spots on it. 'tephritis,' or 'ash stone,' displays a likeness of the new moon with curving horns, but on a ground that is the colour of ash. the 'tecolithos,' or 'solvent stone,' looks like an olive stone and has no value as a gem, but when sucked breaks up and disperses stone in the bladder.
