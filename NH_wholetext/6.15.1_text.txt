the caspian and hyrcanian sea: bursting through, this sea makes a passage from the scythian ocean into the back of asia, receiving various names from the nations which dwell upon its banks, the two most famous of which are the caspian and the hyrcanian races. clitarchus is of opinion that the caspian sea is not less in area than the euxine. eratosthenes gives the measure of it on the south-east, along the coast of cadusia and albania, as five thousand four hundred stadia; thence, through the territories of the anariaci, the amardi, and the hyrcani, to the mouth of the river zonus he makes four thousand eight hundred stadia, and thence to the mouth of the jaxartes two thousand four hundred; which makes in all a distance of one thousand five hundred and seventy-five miles. artemidorus, however, makes this sum smaller by twenty-five miles. agrippa bounds the caspian sea and the nations around it, including armenia, on the east by the ocean of the seres, on the west by the chain of the caucasus, on the south by that of taurus, and on the north by the scythian ocean; and he states it, so far as its extent is known, to be four hundred and eighty miles in length, and two hundred and ninety in breadth. there are not wanting, however, some authors who state that its whole circumference, from the straits, is two thousand five hundred miles.
