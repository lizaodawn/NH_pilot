man has tonsils, the pig glands. man alone has what is called the uvula hanging from the back of the palate between the tonsils. no oviparous species possesses the lesser tongue below the uvula. its functions are twofold, placed as it is between two, tubes. of these the inner one called the windpipe stretches to the lungs and the heart; this the lesser tongue closes while food is being eaten, as breath and voice passes along it, lest if drink or food should pass into the wrong channel, it might cause pain. the other, the outer tube, is of course called the gullet, down which food and drink fall; this leads to the stomach, and the stomach to the abdomen. this passage the lesser tongue occasionally closes, when only breath or voice is passing, so that an untimely rising of the stomach may not interfere. the windpipe consists of gristle and flesh, the gullet of sinew and flesh.
