besides the cultivated cunila there are several other kinds used in medicine. the one called ox cunila has a seed like that of pennyroyal which is curative if chewed and applied to wounds provided that the bandage is not taken off till the fifth day after. for the bites of serpents it is taken in wine and applied to the wound after being pounded. the bites made by serpents they rub ... likewise tortoises that are going to fight with serpents. certain people call it panacea (all-heal) in this connection. it relieves tumours and troubles of the male organs, applied dry or after pounding the leaves; for every use it combines wonderfully well with wine.
