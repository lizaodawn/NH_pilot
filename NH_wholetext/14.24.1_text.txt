but it may also be proper to give an account of the method of preparing wine, as greek authors have written special treatises on this subject and have made a scientific system for it â€” for instance euphronius, aristomachus, commiades and hicesius. the practice in africa is to soften any roughness with gypsum, and also in some parts of the country with lime. in greece, on the other hand, they enliven the smoothness of their wines with potter's earth or marble dust or salt or seawater, while in some parts of italy they use resinous pitch for this purpose, and it is the general practice both there and in the neighbouring provinces to season must with resin; in some places they use the lees of older wine or else vinegar for seasoning. moreover, medicaments for this purpose are also made from the must itself: it is boiled down so as to become sweeter in proportion to its strength, and it is said that must so reared does not last beyond a year's time. in some places they boil the must down into what is called sapa, and pour this into their wines to overcome their harshness. still both in the case of this kind of wine and in all others they supply the vessels themselves with coatings of pitch, the method of making which will be described in the next volume.
