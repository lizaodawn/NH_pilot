so much for the sculptors in marble and the artists who have achieved the greatest fame. in discussing this subject, however, i am reminded that in those times no value was attached to marble with markings. apart from the marble of the cyclades, sculptors worked in that of thasos, which rivals it, and of lesbos, which has a slightly more bluish tinge. markings of various colours and decorations of marble in general are first mentioned by that most accurate exponent of the details of high living, menander, and even he rarely alludes to them. marble columns were certainly used in temples, not, however, as an embellishment, since embellishments as such were not yet appreciated, but merely because there was no way of erecting stronger columns. thus they are a feature of the unfinished temple of jupiter olympius at athens, from which sulla brought columns to be used for temples on the capitol. however, ordinary stone and marble were distinguished already in homer, for he speaks of a man being struck by a piece of marble; but this is as far as he goes. he decorates even his royal palaces, however sumptuously, only with ivory, apart from metals â€” bronze, gold, electrum and silver. in my opinion, the first specimens of our favourite marbles with their parti-coloured markings appeared from the quarries of chios when the people of that island were building their walls. hence the witty remark made at the expense of this work by cicero. it was their practice to show it as a splendid structure to all their visitors; and his remark to them was 'i should be much more amazed if you had made it of stone from tibur.' and, heaven knows, painting would not have been valued at all, let alone so highly, had marbles enjoyed any considerable prestige.
