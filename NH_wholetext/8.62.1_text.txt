the genus dog breeds twice a year. maturity for reproduction begins at the age of one. they carry their young for sixty days. puppies are born blind, and acquire sight the more slowly the more copious the milk with which they are suckled; though the blind period never lasts more than three weeks or less than one. some people report that a puppy born singly sees on the 9th day, twins on the 10th, and so on, a corresponding number of days' delay in seeing light being added for each extra puppy; and that a bitch of a first litter begins to see sooner. the best in a litter is the one that begins to see last, or else the one that the mother carries into the kennel first after delivery.
