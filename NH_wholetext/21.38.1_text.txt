the first flower to herald the approach of spring is the white violet, which moreover in the warmer spots peeps out even in winter. afterwards comes the violet which is called ion, and the mauve one, followed closely by the flame-coloured flower called phlox, but only the wild variety. the cyclamen blossoms twice in the year, in spring and in autumn; it shuns summer and winter. a little later than those mentioned above come, overseas, the narcissus and the lily, which in italy, as we have said, is after the rose. but in greece comes later still the anemone. this however is a flower of the wild bulbs, and different from the plant to be spoken of among the medicinal herbs. it is followed by the oenanthe the melanium and the wild heliochrysus, then the other kind of anemone, which is called the meadow anemone, after which comes the gladiolus, together with the hyacinth. the last to bloom is the rose, which is also the first to fade, except the cultivated kind. of the others, the hyacinth lasts longest in flower with the white violet and the oenanthe, but the last only if by repeated plucking it is prevented from running to seed. it grows in warm districts, and has the same scent as forming grapes: hence the name. the hyacinth is associated with two forms of a legend; one that it displays the mourning for that youth whom apollo had loved, and the other that it sprang from the shed blood of ajax, the veins of the flower being so arranged that on it is to be read al inscribed in the form of greek letters. heliochrysus has a flower like gold, a slight leaf and also a slender but hard stem. the magi think that to wear a chaplet of this plant, if unguents too be taken from a box of the gold called apyron, leads also to popularity and glory in life. these then are the flowers of spring.
