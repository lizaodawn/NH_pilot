avoid attending to the vine at midwinter. hyginus recommends straining the wine then, or even racking it off a week after the shortest day has passed, provided a week-old moon coincides with it; and planting cherries about midwinter. it is proper at that date to put acorns in soak as fodder for oxen, a peck per yoke - a larger quantity is injurious to their health; and it is said that whenever they are given this feed, if it is not fed to them for at least 30 days in succession, an outbreak of mange in the spring will cause you to repent. we have given this as the time for cutting timber; and the other kinds of work may be arranged chiefly in the night time, as the nights are so much longer - weaving wicker baskets, hampers and rush baskets, cutting torches, preparing squared vine-props at the rate of thirty and rounded poles at the rate of sixty a day in daytime, and by artificial light five props and ten poles in an evening and the same number in the early morning.
