leontopetalon, called by some rapadion, has leaves like cabbage leaves and a stem half a foot long. there are several side branches, and at the ends, in pods like those of chick-peas, is the seed. the root is like a turnip, large and blackish. it grows on cultivated ground. taken in wine the root neutralises the poison of serpents of every kind [or 'of the bites of all serpents'], and no other remedy acts more quickly. it is also given to sufferers from sciatica.
