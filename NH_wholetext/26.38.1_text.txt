it is by relaxing the stomach that a scamonium too brings away bile and loosens the bowels, unless indeed to two oboli of it are added two drachmae of aloes. this is the juice of a plant with many branches at the root, fleshy, three-cornered, pale leaves, and a thick, wet, nauseating root. it grows in rich, pale soil. near the rising of the dog-star a hollow is made in this root, so that the juice may collect in it automatically; this is dried in the sun and worked into lozenges. the root itself or the skin is also dried. the kind most approved grows in the regions of colophon, mysia and priene. this is shiny, as like as possible to bull glue, spongy with very fine cracks, quickly melting, with a poisonous smell, gummy, becoming like milk at a touch of the tongue, extremely light, and turning white when dissolved. this happens too with bastard scamonmm, which is made, generally in judea, with flour of bitter vetch and juice of sea spurge, and even chokes those who take it. the bastard kind is detected by the taste, for the genuine burns the tongue. it is to be used when two years old, being of no use either before or after. it has been prescribed by itself in water or in hydromel and salt, the dose being four oboli, but most effectively with aloes, though honey wine must be taken as soon as purging begins. the root too is boiled down in vinegar to the consistency of honey, the decoction being applied to leprous sores, and with oil it is used as an ointment for the head when there is headache.
