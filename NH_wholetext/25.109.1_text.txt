we call ranunculus a plant which the greeks call batrachion. there are four kinds of it: one with fatter leaves than those of coriander and nearly as broad as those of mallows, of a leaden colour, with a tall, graceful stem and a whitish root. it grows on moist and shaded cross-paths. the second is more leafy, with more indentations in the leaves, and with taller stems. the third is the smallest, with a strong smell and a golden flower. the fourth is like it, but the flower is of the colour of milk. all have a caustic property; if leaves are applied raw, they raise blisters as does fire. accordingly they are used for leprous sores and itch, and to remove scars on the skin; they are ingredients of all caustic preparations. they are applied to mange, but are removed quickly. the root if chewed up for toothache too long breaks off the teeth, and the dried root chopped flue makes a snuff. roman herbalists call it strumus, because it cures scrofula and superficial abscesses, if a piece of it is hung up in the smoke. they believe that if it is replanted the maladies they have cured break out again, a similar criminal use being made of the plantain. sores inside the mouth are cured by juice of plantain, and also by the chewed-up leaves and roots, even if the mouth is suffering from a flux; sores and bad breath are removed by cinquefoil, sores by psyllium.
