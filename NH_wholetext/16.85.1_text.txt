if one thinks of the remote regions of the world and the impenetrable forests, it is possible that some trees have an immeasurable span of life. but of those that the memory of man preserves there still live an olive planted by the hand of the elder africanus on his estate at liternum and likewise a myrtle of remarkable size in the same place — underneath them is a grotto in which a snake is said to keep guard over africanus's shade — and a lotus tree in the precinct of lucina at rome founded in 375 b.c., a year in which no magistrates were elected; how much older the tree itself is uncertain, but at all events there is no doubt that it is older, since it is from the grove in question that the goddess lucina takes her name. this tree is now about 500 years old; still older, though its age is uncertain, is the lotus free called the hair tree, because the vestal virgins' offering of hair is brought to it.
