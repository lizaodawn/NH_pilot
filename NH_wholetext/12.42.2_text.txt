the actual shrub of the cinnamon is only about three feet high at the most, the smallest being only a span high, and four inches thick, and it throws out shoots as low as six inches from the ground; it has a dried up appearance, and while it is green has no scent; the leaf is like that of the wild marjoram; it likes a dry soil and is less fertile in wet weather; and it stands constant clipping. though it grows on level ground, it flourishes among the thickest bushes and brambles, and is difficult to gather. it can only be cut 'with the leave of the god' - which some understand to mean jove, but the ethiopian name for him is assabinus. they sacrifice 44 oxen, goats and rams to obtain leave to cut it, though this does not include permission to do so before sunrise or after sunset. a priest divides the twigs with a spear, and sets aside a portion for the god, while the rest is packed up in clumps by the dealer. another account is also given, that a share is assigned to the sun, and that the wood is divided into three portions, and then lots are cast twice to assign the shares, and the share that falls to the sun is left, and bursts out in flames of its own accord.
