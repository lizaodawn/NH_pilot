such is all that i have been told or discovered worth recording about plants. at the close, i think it not out of place to add a warning that their properties vary with their age. as i have said, elaterium lasts longest, dark chamaeleon forty years, centaury not more than twelve, peucedanum and aristolochia up to six, and the wild vine one year - that is, if they are kept in the shade. and of external animals indeed none attack the roots that i have mentioned except the sphondyle, a kind of creeping thing, which infests them all.
