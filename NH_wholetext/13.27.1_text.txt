there are important instances forthcoming that make against the opinion of marcus varro in regard to the history of paper. cassius hemina, a historian of great antiquity, has stated in his annals, book 4, that the secretary gnaeus terentius, when digging over his land on the janiculan, turned up a coffer that had contained the body of numa, who was king at rome, and that in the same coffer were found some books of his - this was in the consulship of publius 181 bc. cornelius cethegus, son of lucius, and of marcus baebius tamphilus, son of quintus, dating 535 years after the accession of numa; and the historian says that the books were made of paper, which makes the matter still more remarkable, because of their having lasted in a hole in the ground, and consequently on a point of such importance i will quote the words of hemina himself: 'other people wondered how those books could have lasted so long, but terentius's explanation was that about in the middle of the coffer there had been a square stone tied all round with waxed cords, and that the three books had been placed on the top of this stone; and he thought this position was the reason why they had not decayed; and that the books had been soaked in citrus-oil, and he thought that this was why they were not moth-eaten. these books contained the philosophical doctrines of pythagoras' - and hemina said that the books had been burnt by the praetor quintus petilius because they were writings of philosophy [prob. an interpolation]. the same story is recorded by piso the former censor in his commentaries, book i, but he says that there were seven volumes of pontifical law and the same number of pythagorean philosophy; while tuditanus in book x3 says that there were twelve volumes of the decrees of numa; varro himself says that there were seven volumes of antiquities of man, and antias in his second book speaks of there having been twelve volumes on matters pontifical written in latin and the same number in greek containing doctrines of philosophy; antias also quotes in book 3 a resolution of the senate deciding that these volumes were to be burnt. it is however universally agreed that the sibyl brought three volumes to tarquin the proud, of which two were burnt by herself while the third was destroyed in the burning of the capitol in the sulla crisis. moreover the mucianus who was three times consul has stated that recently, when governor of lycia, he had read in a certain temple a letter of sarpedon written on paper at troy - which seems to me even more remarkable if even when homer was writing, egypt did not yet exist: otherwise why, if paper was already in use, is it known to have been the custom to write on folding tablets made of lead or sheets of linen, or why has homer stated that even in lycia itself wooden tablets, and not letters, were given to bellerophon? this commodity also is liable to dearth, and as early as the principate of tiberius a shortage of paper led to the appointment from the senate of umpires to supervise its distribution, as otherwise life was completely upset.
