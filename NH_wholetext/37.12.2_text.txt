however, amber is found to have some use in pharmacy, although it is not for this reason that women like it. it is of benefit to babies when it is attached to them as an amulet. callistratus says that it is good also for people of any age as a remedy for attacks of wild distraction and for strangury, both taken in liquid and worn as an amulet. this writer also introduces a fresh distinction, giving the name 'chryselectrum,' or 'gold amber,' to a kind which is golden in colour and has a most delightful appearance early in the day, but which very easily catches fire and flares up in a moment when it is close to flames. according to callistratus, this kind of amber cures fevers and diseases when worn as an amulet on a necklace, affections of the ears when powdered and mixed with honey and rose oil, as well as weak sight if it is powdered and blended with attic honey, and affections even of the stomach if it is either taken as a fine powder by itself or swallowed in water with mastic. amber plays an important part also in the making of artificial transparent gems, particularly artificial amethysts, although, as i have mentioned, it can be dyed any colour.
