however, all these houses were surpassed by two. twice have we seen the whole city girdled by imperial palaces, those of gaius and nero, the latter's palace, to crown all, being indeed a house of gold. such, doubtless, were the dwellings of those who made this empire great, who went straight from plough or hearth to conquer nations and win triumphs, whose very lands occupied a smaller space than those emperors' sitting-rooms! indeed, one begins to reflect how small in comparison with those palaces were the building-sites formally granted by the state to invincible generals for their private houses. the highest distinction that these houses displayed was one accorded, for example, after his many services to publius valerius publicola, the first of our consuls along with lucius brutus, and to his brother, who — also as consul — inflicted two crushing defeats on the sabines. i refer to the additional decree which provided that the doors of their houses should be made to open outwards so that the portals could be flung open on to the public highway. this was the most notable mark of distinction in the houses even of men who had celebrated a triumph.
