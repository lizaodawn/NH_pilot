vetch also enriches the soil, and it too vets. entails no labour for the farmer, as it is sown after only one furrowing, and it is not hoed or manured, but only harrowed in. there are three seasons for sowing it - about the time of the setting of arcturus, so that it may provide pasture in december - at that date it is best sown for seed, for it bears seed just as well when grazed down; the second sowing is in january, and the last in march, which is the best crop for providing green fodder. of all crops sown vetch is the one that is fondest of a dry soil; it does not dislike even shady localities. if it is picked when ripe, its grain supplies chaff that is preferred to all others. if sown in a vineyard planted with trees it takes away the juice from the vines and makes them droop.
