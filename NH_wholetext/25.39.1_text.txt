the physician themiso too has spread the fame of a common plant, the plantain, having published a treatise about it as though he were the discoverer. there are two kinds of it: the smaller, with narrower and darker leaves, resembles the tongue of a sheep; the stem is angular and bends downward. it grows in meadows. the other kind is larger and enclosed with leaves as it were with sides. since these leaves are seven in number the plant is sometimes called heptapleuron. the stem too of this is a cubit high; when it grows on wet soils it is much more efficacious. it has a wonderful power to dry and brace the body, having a cauterizing property. there is nothing that checks so well the fluxes called by the greeks rheumatismoi, that is, catarrhs.
