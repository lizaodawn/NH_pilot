the very first men to make a name as sculptors in marble were dipoenus and scyllis, who were born in the island of crete while media was still a great power and cyrus had not yet come to the throne of persia. their date falls approximately in the 50th olympiad. they made their way to sikyon, which was for long the motherland of all such industries. the men of sikyon had given them a contract in the name of the state for making statues of gods; but before these were finished the artists complained that they had been wronged and went away to aitolia. sikyon was instantly stricken with famine, barrenness and fearful affliction. when the people begged the oracle for relief, apollo of delphi replied that relief would come 'if dipoenus and scyllis completed the images of the gods.' this they were prevailed upon to do thanks to the payment of high fees and high compliments. the statues, incidentally, were those of apollo, diana, hercules and minerva, the last of which was later struck by lightning.
