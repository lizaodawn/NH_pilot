to return to timanthes â€” he had a very high degree of genius. orators have sung the praises of his iphigenia, who stands at the altar awaiting her doom; the artist has shown all present full of sorrow, and especially her uncle, and has exhausted all the indications of grief, yet has veiled the countenance of her father himself whom he was unable adequately to portray. there are also other examples of his genius, for instance a quite small panel of a sleeping cyclops, whose gigantic stature he aimed at representing even on that scale by painting at his side some satyrs measuring the size of his thumb with a wand. indeed timanthes is the only artist in whose works more is always implied than is depicted, and whose execution, though consummate, is always surpassed by his genius. he painted a hero which is a work of supreme perfection, in which he has included the whole art of painting male figures; this work is now in the temple of peace in rome.
