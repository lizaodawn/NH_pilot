the subsequent story of medicine, strange to say, lay hidden in darkest night down to the peloponnesian war, when it was restored to the light by hippocrates, who was born in the very famous and powerful island of cos, sacred to aesculapius. it had been the custom for patients recovered from illness to inscribe in the temple of that god an account of the help that they had received, so that afterwards similar remedies might be enjoyed. accordingly hippocrates, it is said, wrote out these inscriptions, and, as our countryman varro believes, after the temple had been burnt, founded that branch of medicine called 'clinical.' afterwards there was no limit to the profit from medical practice, for one of the pupils of hippocrates, prodicus, born in selymbria, founded iatraliptice ('ointment cure'), and so discovered revenue for the anointers even and drudges of the doctors.
