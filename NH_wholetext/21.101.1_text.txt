batis (sea-fennel) too relaxes the bowels. crushed up it is used raw as a liniment for gout. the egyptians sow acinos both for chaplets and for food; it would be just the same as ocimum were it not for its rougher branches and leaves, and for its very strong smell. it is both an emmenagogue and diuretic.
