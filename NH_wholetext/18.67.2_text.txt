well then, a list of things to be done: to plant olive-cuttings and rake over between the olive trees themselves; in the first days of the equinox to irrigate the meadows; when the grass has grown to a stalk, to shut off the water; to trim the vine (the vine too has a rule of its own: it must be trimmed when the shoots have made four inches in length â€” one hand can trim an acre); to stir over the corn crops again (hoeing takes 20 days). it is thought that to start hoeing at the equinox injures both vines and corn. this is also the time for washing sheep.
