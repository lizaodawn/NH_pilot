medical men recommend giving raw radishes with salt for the purpose of concentrating the crude humours of the bowels, and they use this mixture to act as an emetic. they also say that radish juice is an essential specific for disease of the diaphragm, inasmuch as in egypt, when the kings ordered post mortem dissections to be made for the purpose of research into the nature of diseases, it was discovered that this was the only dose that was capable of removing phtheiriasis attacking the internal parts of the heart. also it is said that the radish was rated so far above all other articles of food that, such is the frivolity of the greeks, in the temple of apollo at delphi, a radish modelled in gold was dedicated as a votive offering, though only a silver beetroot and a turnip of lead. you might be sure that manius curius was not a native of delphi, the general who is recorded in our annals to have been found by the enemy's envoys roasting a turnip at the fire, when they came bringing the gold which he was going indignantly to refuse. also the greek author moschion wrote a whole volume about the radish. radishes are considered an extremely valuable article of food in winter time, though at the same time people think them to be always bad for the teeth, because they wear them down; at all events they can be used for polishing ivory. there is a great antipathy between radishes and vines, which shrink away from radishes planted near them.
