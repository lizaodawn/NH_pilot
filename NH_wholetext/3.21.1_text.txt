the eleventh region of italy; italia transpaidana. from the river padus the eleventh region receives its name of transpadana; to which, situate as it is wholly in the interior, the river, by its bounteous channel, conveys the gifts of all the seas. the towns are vibi forum and segusio; and, at the foot of the alps, the colony of augusta taurinorum, at which place the padus becomes navigable, and which was founded by the ancient race of the ligurians, and of augusta praetoria of the salassi, near the two passes of the alps, the grecian and the penine (by the latter it is said that the carthaginians passed into italy, by the grecian, hercules) — the town of eporedia, the foundation of which by the roman people was enjoined by the sibylline books; the gauls call tamers of horses by the name of "eporediae" — vercellae, the town of the libici, derived its origin from the salluvii, and novaria, founded by the vertacomacori, is at the present day a district of the vocontii, and not, as cato supposes, of the ligurians; of whom two nations, called the laevi and the marici, founded ticinum, not far from the padus, as the boii, descended from the transalpine nations, have founded laus pompeia and the insubres mediolanum.
