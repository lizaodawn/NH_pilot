poterion, or as some call it, phrynion or neuras, is a spreading shrub, shrivelled and prickly, with thick down, small round leaves, long branches that are soft, flexible and slender, and a long flower of a grass-green colour. the seed is not used in medicine, but has a sham, aromatic taste. the plant is found on moist hills. it has two or three roots, two cubits in depth, sinewy, white and firm. it is dug np in autumn, and when the shrub has been cut away, the root yields a juice like gum. an application of the root is said to be a wonderful healer of wounds, especially of sinews even when they have been severed. a decoction of the root also, taken with honey, is good for relaxed, weak, or cut sinews.
