pannonia: next to them comes acorn-bearing pannonia, along which the chain of the alps, gradually lessening as it runs through the middle of illyricum from north to south, forms a gentle slope on the right hand and the left. the portion which looks towards the adriatic sea is called dalmatia and illyricum, above mentioned, while pannonia stretches away towards the north, and has the danube for its extreme boundary. in it are the colonies of aemona and siscia. the following rivers, both known to fame and adapted for commerce, flow into the danube; the draus, which rushes from noricum with great impetuosity, and the savus, which flows with a more gentle current from the carnic alps, there being a space between them of 120 miles. the draus runs through the serretes, the serrapilli, the iasi, and the andizetes; the savus through the colapiani and the breuci; these are the principal peoples. besides them there are the arivates, the azali, the amantini, the belgites, the catari, the cornacates, the eravisci, the hercuniates, the latovici, the oseriates, the varciani, and, in front of mount claudius, the scordisci, behind it the taurisci. in the savus there is the island of metubarris, the greatest of all the islands formed by rivers. besides the above, there are these other rivers worthy of mention: â€” the colapis, which flows into the savus near siscia, where, dividing its channel, it forms the island which is called segestica a; and the river bacuntius, which flows into the savus at the town of sirmium, where we find the state of the sirmienses and the amantini. forty-five miles thence is taurunum, where the savus flows into the danube; above which spot the valdanus and the urpanus, themselves far from ignoble rivers, join that stream.
