in human beings only a double-crowned skull occurs in some cases. the bones of the human skull are flat and thin and have no marrow; they are constructed with interlockings serrated like the teeth of a comb. when broken they cannot form again, but the removal of a moderate piece is not fatal, as its place is taken by a scar of flesh. the skull of the bear is the weakest and that of the parrot the hardest, as we have stated in the proper place.
