lycium juice dyes the hair flaxen; hypericum, also called corissum, dyes it black, as does ophrys, a plant like indented cabbage, but with only two leaves. polemonia, too, boiled down in oil, imparts a black colour. depilatories i myself indeed regard as a woman's cosmetic, but now today men also use them. but very efficacious is held to be archezostis, as also the tithymalli, the juice being applied frequently with oil either in the sun or when the hairs have been pulled out. hyssop in oil heals the itch in quadrupeds, and sideritis is specific for the quinsy in swine. but i must go on to describe the remaining kinds of plants.
