that animal, which is also a native of egypt, is specially known because of this exploit. the asp repeatedly plunges into mud and dries itself in the sun, and then when it has equipped itself with a cuirass of several coatings by the same method, it proceeds to the encounter. in this it raises its tail and renders the blows it receives ineffectual by turning away from them, till after watching for its opportunity, with head held sideways it attacks its adversary's throat. and not content with this victim it vanquishes another animal no less ferocious, the crocodile.
