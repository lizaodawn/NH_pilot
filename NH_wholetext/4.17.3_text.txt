upon the coast of the macedonian gulf there are the town of chalastra, and, more inland, piloros; also lete, and at the extreme bend of the gulf, thessalonica, a free city; (from this place to dyrrhachium it is 245 miles,) and then thermae. upon the gulf of thermae are the towns of dicaea, pydna, derra, scione, the promontory of canastraion, and the towns of pallene and phlegra. in this region also are the mountains hypsizorus, epitus, halcyone, and elaeuomne; the towns of nyssos, phryxelon, mendae, and what was formerly potidaea on the isthmus of pallene, but now the colony of cassandria; anthemus, olophyxus, and the gulf of mecyberna; the towns of miscella, ampelos, torone, singos, and the canal, a mile and a half in length, by means of which xerxes, king of the persians, cut off mount athos from the main land. this mountain projects from the level plain of the adjacent country into the sea, a distance of seventy-five miles; its circumference at its base being 150 miles in extent. there was formerly upon its summit the town of acroathon: the present towns are uranopolis, palaeorium, thyssus, kleonai, and apollonia, the inhabitants of which have the surname of macrobii. the town also of cassera, and then the other side of the isthmus, after which come acanthus, stagira, sithone, heraclea, and the country of mygdonia that lies below, in which are situate, at some distance from the sea, apollonia and arethusa. again, upon the coast we have posidium, and the bay with the town of cermorus, amphipolis, a free town, and the nation of the bisaltae. we then come to the river strymon which takes its rise in mount haemus and forms the boundary of macedonia: it is worthy of remark that it first discharges itself into seven lakes before it proceeds onward in its course.
