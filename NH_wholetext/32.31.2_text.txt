the myax also is purgative, and in this place shall be set forth all its characteristics. these animals form clusters, as does the murex, and live where seaweed lies thick, for which reason they are most delicious in autumn, and from regions where much fresh water mingles with salt, for which reason it is in egypt that they are most esteemed. as the winter advances, they contract a bitter taste, and a red colour. their liquor is said to be a thorough purge of belly and bladder, cleanses the intestines, is a universal aperient, purges the kidneys, and reduces blood and fat. hence these shell-fish are very beneficial for dropsy, menstruation, jaundice, diseases of the joints, flatulence, obesity also, bilious phlegm, affections of lungs, liver, and spleen, and for catarrhs, their only drawback is that they harm the throat and obstruct the voice. ulcers that are creeping or need cleansing they heal, and also, if burnt as is the murex, malignant growths. with honey added they heal the bites of dogs and men, leprous sores, and freckles. their ash, washed, is good for dim vision, roughness and white ulcers of the eyes, affections of the gums and teeth and outbursts of phlegm. against dorycnium and opocarpathum they serve as an antidote. there are two inferior kinds: the mitulus, with a salty, strong taste; the myisca, different in its roundness, rather smaller and hairy, with thinner shell and sweeter flesh. the mitulus too like the murex has a caustic ash good for leprous sores, freckles, and spots. they are washed a also as is lead for thick eyelids, white ulcers, dim vision, dirty ulcers in other parts and pustules on the head. their flesh makes an application for dog bites.
