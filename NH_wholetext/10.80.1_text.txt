unfertile eggs, which we have designated wind-eggs, are conceived by the hen birds mating together in a pretence of sexual intercourse, or else from dust, and not only by hen pigeons but also by farmyard hens, partridges, peahens, geese and ducks. but these eggs are sterile, and of smaller size and less agreeable flavour, and more watery. some people think they are actually generated by the wind, for which reason they are also called zephyr's eggs; but wind-eggs are only produced in spring, when the hens have left off sitting: another name for them is addle-eggs. when steeped in vinegar eggs become so much softer that they can be passed through rings. it pays best to keep them in bean meal, or else chaff in winter and bran in summer; it is believed that keeping them in salt drains them quite empty.
