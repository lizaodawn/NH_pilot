astragalus has long leaves with many slanting incisions, around the root three or four stems covered with leaves, blossom like that of the hyacinthus, and roots that are hairy, matted, red and very hard. it grows on stony ground that is exposed to sunshine and also to falls of snow, like the ground around pheneus in arcadia. its property is to brace the body. its root, taken in wine, checks looseness of the bowels, a result of which is that it is diuretic by forcing back their fluid, as most things do that check looseness. it cures dysentery also when ground in light-red wine, but it is ground only with difficulty. fomentation with the same plant is very good for gum-boils. it is gathered at the end of autumn, when it has lost its leaves, and is dried in the shade.
