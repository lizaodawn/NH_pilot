many birds in this class feed also on acorns and fruit, but those that eat only flesh do not drink, excepting the kite, and for a kite to drink counts in itself as a direful augury. the birds having talons never live in flocks, and each hunts for itself. but they almost all except the night-birds among them fly high, and the bigger ones higher. all have large wings and a small body. they walk with difficulty. they rarely perch on rocks, as the curve of their talons prohibits this.
