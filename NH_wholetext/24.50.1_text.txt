i have pointed out twenty-eight kinds of reed, and nowhere is more obvious that force of nature which i describe in these books one after another, if indeed the root of the reed, crushed and applied, draws a fern stem out of the flesh, while the root of the fern does the same to a splinter of reed. to increase the number of the various reeds there is that which grows in judea and syria and is used for scents and unguents; boiled down with grass or celery seed this is diuretic, and when made into a pessary acts as an emmenagogue. a cure for sprains, for troubles of the liver and of the kidneys, and for dropsy, is two oboli taken in drink; for a cough also inhalation is used, the addition of resin being an improvement; for scurf and running sores is used a decoction with myrrh. its juice also is collected and made into a drug like elaterium. of all reeds the parts nearest the root are the most efficacious, and the joints are more efficacious than other pads. the cyprian reed, called donax, has a bark which, reduced to ash, is a remedy for mange and also for festering sores. its leaves are used for extracting splinters, and are also good for erysipelas and for all gatherings. the common reed has the power to extract if freshly pounded, and not the root only, for many hold that the reed itself too has this property. the root applied in vinegar cures dislocations and pains of the spine; the same ground fresh and taken in wine is aphrodisiac. the down on reeds placed in the ears deadens the hearing.
