cornelius alexander mentions a tree called the hon-tree, the timber of which he says was used to build the argo, which bears mistletoe resembling that on the oak, and which cannot be rotted by water or destroyed by fire, the same being the case with its mistletoe. this tree is, so far as i am aware, unknown to anyone else.
