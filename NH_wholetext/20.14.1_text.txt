like the parsnip is the hibiscum, which some call the wild mallow, and others ï€î»îµî¹ïƒï„î¿î»î¿ï‡îµî¯î±; it is a cure for ulcers and for broken cartilages and bones. the leaves, taken in water, relax the bowels; they keep serpents away, and used as a liniment heal the stings of bees, wasps and hornets. its root dug up before sunrise is wrapped in wool of the colour called natural, taken moreover from a ewe that has given birth to a ewe lamb, and bound on scrofulous sores, even when they have suppurated. some think that when it is to be used for this purpose the root should be dug up with a tool of gold, care being taken not to let it touch the ground. celsus too prescribes a decoction of the root in wine as a liniment for cases of gout without swelling.
