as for the 'liparea,' the only fact that is reported is that, when it is burnt, all beasts are flushed from their hiding-places by its fumes. the 'lysimachos' is similar to rhodian marble with golden-yellow veins, and has to be considerably reduced in size by polishing so that its superfluous excrescences may be smoothed away. the 'leucochrysos,' or 'golden-white stone,' consists of a 'chrysolithos' interspersed with white.
