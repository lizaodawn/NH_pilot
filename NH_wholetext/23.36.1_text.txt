white olives are more useful to the stomach, less so to the belly. fresh and eaten by themselves as food before they are preserved, they are of excellent use, curing gravel and improving teeth that have been worn or loosened by chewing meat. the dark olive is less useful to the stomach, better for the belly, but of no use to the head and eyes. both sorts, applied after pounding, are good for burns; the dark, however, is chewed up, and if applied at once from the mouth to the affected part prevents the formation of pustules. olives preserved in brine cleanse foul ulcers, but are bad for strangury.
