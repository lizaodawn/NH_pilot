it is said that at argos there still survives the olive to which argus tethered io after she had been transformed into a heifer. west of heraclea in pontus there are altars dedicated to jupiter under his greek title of stratios, where there are two oak trees planted by hercules. in the same region there is a port called harbour of amyeus, famous as the place where king bebryx was killed; his tomb ever since the day of his death has been shaded by a laurel tree which they call the mad laurel, because if a piece plucked from it is taken on board ships, quarrelling breaks out until it is thrown away. we have mentioned the region of aulocrene, traversed by the route leading from apamea into phrygia; in it travellers are shown the plane-tree from which marsyas was hanged after losing his match with apollo, and which was selected for the purpose on account of its size even then. moreover at delos may be seen a palm tree dating back to the time of the same deity, and at olympia a wild olive from which was made the wreath with which hercules was crowned for the first time â€” veneration for it is preserved even now. also the olive tree produced by minerva in the competition a is reported still to exist at athens.
