the chamelaea ('ground olive') has leaves which resemble those of the olive - they are bitter, however, and scented - growing in rocky places and not exceeding a span in height. it purges the bowels, and draws away phlegm and bile; a decoction is made of the leaves with twice the quantity of wormwood, this juice being drunk with honey.
