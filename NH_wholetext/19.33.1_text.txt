it may also be suitable to mention the leek in this family of plants, especially as importance has recently been given to the chive by the emperor nero, who on certain fixed days of every month always ate chives preserved in oil, and nothing else, not even bread, for the sake of his voice. it is grown from seed sown just after the autumnal equinox; if it is for the purpose of chives, it must be sown rather thickly. it goes on being cut in the same bed till it gives out; and if it is being grown to make heads it is always well manured before it is cut. when it is fully grown, it is moved to another bed, after having the points of the leaves above the central part carefully trimmed off and the tips of the coats drawn back from the heads. growers in former times used to broaden out the heads by putting them under a stone or a potsherd, and the same with bulbs as well; but now the practice is gently to pull the roots loose with a hoe, so that being bent they may feed the plant and not draw it apart. it is a remarkable fact that although the leek likes manure and a rich soil, it hates damp places. nevertheless there is a connexion between the varieties and some peculiarity of the soil: the most highly esteemed kind belongs to egypt, and the next to ostia and to la iticcia. there are two kinds of chive; one with grass-green leaves, with distinct markings on them — this is the chive used by druggists — and another kind with leaves of a yellower colour and rounder in shape, on which the markings are less prominent. there is a story that a member of the order of knights named mela, when recalled from a deputy-governorship by the emperor tiberius to be impeached for maladministration, in extreme despair swallowed a dose of leek-juice weighing three denarii in silver, and immediately expired without suffering any pain. a larger dose is said to have no injurious effect.
