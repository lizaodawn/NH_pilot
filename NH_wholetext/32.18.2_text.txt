the magi add also other details, and if there is any truth in them, frogs should be considered more beneficial than laws to the life of mankind. they say that if frogs are pierced with a reed from the genitals through the mouth, and if the husband plants a shoot in his wife's menstrual discharge she conceives an aversion to adulterous lovers. it is certain that frogs' flesh placed in weds or on a hook makes excellent bait for the purple-fish. it is said that the liver of a frog is double, and should be thrown in the way of ants; that the part the ants attack is an antidote for all poisons. some frogs there are that live only in brambles, and so they are called bramble-toads, as i have said, and by the greeks φρύνοι. these are the largest of all frogs, have as it were a pair of horns, and are full of poison. our authorities vie with one another in relating marvellous stories about the toad: that when brought into a meeting of the people silence reigns; that if the little bone found in its right side is let fall into boiling water, the vessel cools, and does not afterwards boil unless the bone is taken out; that it is found when a frog has been thrown to ants and the flesh gnawed away; that one at a time these bones are put into oil; that there is in a frog's left side a bone called 'dog's bane,' which dropped into oil gives the appearance of boiling; by it the attacks of dogs are repelled, and if it is put in drink love and quarrels brought about; that worn as an amulet it acts as an aphrodisiac; that the bone again on the right side cools boiling liquids; cures quartan and other fevers, but love is hat worn in fresh lamb's skin as an amulet this bone restrained. the spleen of these frogs is also a remedy for the poisons that come from them, while their liver is even more efficacious.
