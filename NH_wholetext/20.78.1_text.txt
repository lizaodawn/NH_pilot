of the wild poppy one kind is called ceratitis. black-seeded, a cubit high, with a thick root covered with a hard skin, it has a little calyx curved like a little horn. its leaves are smaller and thinner than those of the other wild varieties. the seed is small, ripening at harvest; half an acetabulum of it, taken in honey wine, acts as a purge. the pounded leaves with oil cure eye-ulcers of beasts of burden. its root, in the proportion of one acetabulum to two sextarii of water, boiled down to one half, is given for complaints of the loins and liver. its leaves applied in honey are a cure for carbuncles. this variety is called glaucion by some and paralium by others, for it grows within reach of the sea breezes or in alkaline soils.
