there is also a wild beet, called by some limonium, by others neuroides, with leaves much smaller, thinner and closer together, often having eleven stalks. its leaves, useful for burns, dry the mouth of those who taste them. its seed, in doses of one acetabulum, is good for dysentery. the liquid moreover decocted from the root of the beet washes out, it is said, the stains on clothes as well as those on parchment.
