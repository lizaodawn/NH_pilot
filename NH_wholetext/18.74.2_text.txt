the agricultural operations that come in these periods of time include sowing turnip and navew, on the days that we have stated. it is commonly thought by country people that it is a mistake to sow turnip after the departure of the stork; our own view however is that it should be sown in any case after the feast of vulcan, and the early kind when italian millet is sown, but that the time for vetch and calavance and plants for fodder is after the setting of the lyre; it is recommended that this should take place when the moon is silent. this is also the time for getting ready a store of leaves; to collect four leaf-baskets full is a fair day's work for one woodman. if they are stored when the moon is on the wane they do not decay; but they ought not to be dry when collected.
