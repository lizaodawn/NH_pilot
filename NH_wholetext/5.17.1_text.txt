phoenice: we must now return to the coast and to phoenice. there was formerly a town here known as crocodilon; there is still a river of that name: dorum and sycaminon are the names of cities of which the remembrance only exists. we then come to the promontory of carmelus, and, upon the mountain, a town of that name, formerly called acbatana. next to this are getta, jeba, and the river pacida, or belus, which throws up on its narrow banks a kind of sand from which glass is made: this river flows from the marshes of cendebia, at the foot of mount carmelus. close to this river is ptolemais, formerly called ace, a colony of claudius caesar; and then the town of ecdippa, and the promontory known as the white promontory. we next come to the city of tyre, formerly an island, separated from the mainland by a channel of the sea, of great depth, 700 paces in width, but now joined to it by the works which were thrown up by alexander when besieging it, the tyre so famous in ancient times for its offspring, the cities to which it gave birth, leptis, utica, and carthage, - that rival of the roman sway, that thirsted so eagerly for the conquest of the whole earth; gades, too, which she founded beyond the limits of the world. at the present day, all her fame is confined to the production of the murex and the purple. its circumference, including therein palaetyrus, is nineteen miles, the place itself extending twenty-two stadia. the next towns are sarepta and ornithon, and then sidon, famous for its manufacture of glass, and the parent of thebes in boeotia.
