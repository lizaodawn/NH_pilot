let us return from these questions to the remaining facts of nature. we have stated that the stars are attached to the firmament, not assigned to each of us in the way in which the vulgar believe, and dealt out to mortals with a degree of radiance proportionate to the lot of each, the brightest stars to the rich, the smaller ones to the poor, the dim to those who are worn out; they do not each rise with their own human being, nor indicate by their fall that someone's life is being extinguished. there is no such close alliance between us and the sky that the radiance of the stars there also shares our fate of mortality. when the stars are believed to fall, what happens is that owing to their being overfed with a draught of liquid they give back the surplus with a fiery flash, just as with us also we see this occur with a stream of oil when lamps are lit. but the heavenly bodies have a nature that is eternal â€” they interweave the world and are blended with its weft; yet their potency has a powerful influence on the earth, indeed it is owing to the effects that they produce and to their brilliance and magnitude that it has been possible for them to become known with such a degree of precision, as we shall show in the proper place. also the system of the revolutions of the sky will be more appropriately stated when we deal with geography, since it is entirely related to the earth; only we must not postpone the discoveries that have been made as to the zodiac. tradition says that anaximander of miletus in the fifty-eighth olympiad was the first person to discover the obliquity of the zodiac, that is, to open the portals of science; and that next cleostratus explained the signs in it, beginning with the ram and the archer; the firmament itself having been explained long before by atlas.
