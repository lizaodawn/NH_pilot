a gum also is produced in egypt from the acacia-thorn, from a pale tree and a dark, and likewise from a green tree, which is far better than the former two. gum is also produced in galatia; it is very inferior, and comes from a more thorny tree than the others. the seed of all the trees is like the lentil, only both grain and pod are smaller. it is gathered in autumn; if gathered earlier, its tonic properties are too powerful. the pods are steeped in rainwater and then pounded in a mortar. the juice is then extracted from them by presses, and finally thickened into lozenges by exposure to the sun in basins. a juice is also extracted from the leaves, but it is less efficacious. for tanning leather they use the seed instead of gall-nuts. the juice of the leaves and of the galatian acacia is very dark, and considered of little value, as is also the juice of the deep-red kind. the purple gum, the dun-coloured, and that which dissolves most easily â€” these have the highest tonic and cooling qualities these are particularly useful for eye-salves. for purposes the lozenges are washed by some, roasted by others and by others thoroughly burnt. they dye the hair, and cure erysipelas, creeping ulcers, moist complaints of the body, gatherings, bruised joints, chilblains and hangnails. they check excessive menstruation in women and are good for prolapsus of the uterus and anus, also for the eyes and for sores of the mouth and of the genitals.
