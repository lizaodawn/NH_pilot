these artists are rivalled in merit by scopas. he made a venus and a figure of pothos (desire), which are worshipped with the most solemn rites in samothrace. he was responsible also for the apollo on the palatine and the much praised seated vesta in the servilian gardens, along with the two turning-posts on either side of her, of which there are facsimiles in the collection of asinius, where there is also his girl carrying a sacred basket. but most highly esteemed is his composition in the shrine built by cn. domitius in the circus flaminius. there is neptune himself, and with him are thetis and achilles. there are nereids riding on dolphins and mighty fish or on seahorses, and also tritons, 'phorcus' band,' swordfish and a host of other sea creatures, all by the hand of the one man, a magnificent achievement even if it had occupied his whole career. as it is, apart from the works mentioned above and those unknown to us, there is furthermore the colossal seated statue of mars by the same artist in the temple built by brutus callaecus also in the circus, as well as his naked venus in the same place, a work that surpasses the venus of praxiteles and would have brought fame to any locality but rome.
