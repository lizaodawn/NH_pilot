the first person indeed of roman nationality who published an explanation of both kinds of eclipse was sulpicius gallus — the colleague in the consulship of marcus marcellus [166 bce], but at the time military tribune — who delivered the army from fear when on the day before the defeat of king perseus by paulus he was brought before an assembly by the commander-in chief to foretell an eclipse; and later also by writing a treatise. the original discovery was made in greece by thales of miletus, who in the fourth year of the 48th olympiad [585 bce} foretold the eclipse of the sun that occurred in the reign of alyattes, in the 170th year after the foundation of rome. after their time the courses of both stars for 600 years were prophesied by hipparchus, whose work embraced the calendar of the nations and the situations of places and aspects of the peoples — his method being, on the evidence of his contemporaries none other than full partnership in the designs of nature. o mighty heroes, of loftier than mortal estate, who have discovered the law of those great divinities and released the miserable mind of man from fear, mortality dreading as it did in eclipses of the stars crimes or death of some sort (those sublime singers, the bards stesichorus and pindar, clearly felt this fear owing to an eclipse of the sun), or in the dying of the moon inferring that she was poisoned and consequently coming to her aid with a noisy clattering of cymbals (this alarm caused the athenian general nicias, in his ignorance of the cause, to be afraid to lead his fleet out of harbour, so destroying the athenians' resources: all hail to your genius, ye that interpret the heavens and grasp the facts of nature, discoverers of a theory whereby you have vanquished gods and men! for who beholding these truths and the regularity of the stars' periods of trouble (for so it has pleased you to call them), would not forgive his own destiny for the generation of mortals?
