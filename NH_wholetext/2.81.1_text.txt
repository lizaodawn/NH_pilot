the theory of the babylonians deems that even earthquakes and fissures in the ground are caused by the force of the stars that is the cause of all other phenomena, but only by that of those three stars to which they assign thunderbolts; and that they occur when these are travelling with the sun or are in agreement with him, and particularly about the quadratures of the world. on this subject a remarkable and immortal inspiration is attributed (if we can believe it) to the natural philosopher anaximander of miletus, who is said to have warned the spartans to be careful of their city and buildings, because an earthquake was impending; and subsequently the whole of their city collapsed, and also a large part of mount taygetus projecting in the shape of a ship's stern broke off and crashing down on it added to the catastrophe. also another conjecture is attributed to pherecydes the teacher of pythagoras, this also inspired: he is said to have foretold to his fellow-citizens an earthquake, of which he had obtained a premonition in drawing water from a well. assuming the truth of these stories, how far pray can such men even in their lifetime be thought to differ from a god? and though these matters may be left to the estimation of individual judgment; i think it indubitable that their cause is to be attributed to the winds; for tremors of the earth never occur except when the sea is calm and the sky so till that birds are unable to soar because all the breath that carries them has been withdrawn; and never except after wind, doubtless because then the blast has been shut up in the veins and hidden bob lows of the sky. and a trembling in the earth is not different from a thunderclap in a cloud, and a fissure is no different from when an imprisoned current of air by struggling and striving to go forth to freedom causes a flash of lightning to burst out.
