in my account of vine-supporting trees the tree called rumpotinus received a notice. when it does not support a vine there grows near it a plant called by the gauls rodarum. it has a stem with knots, like a twig of a fig-tree; the leaves are those of a nettle, whitish in the centre, but in course of time becoming red all over; the blossom is silvery. if the leaves are beaten up with old axle-grease, without being touched by iron, they are a sovereign remedy for tumours, inflammations and gatherings. after being rubbed with it the patient spits to his right three times. they say that the remedy is more efficacious if three persons of different nationalities do the rubbing from left to right.
