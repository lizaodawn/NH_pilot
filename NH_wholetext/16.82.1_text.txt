fir wood is strongest in a vertical position; it is very suitable for door panels and any kinds of inlaid work desired, whether in the greek or the campanian or the sicilian style of joinery; under brisk planing it makes pretty curly shavings, always twisting in a spiral like the tendrils of a vine; moreover, of all sorts of wood it is most adapted for being glued together, so much so that it will split at a solid place before it parts at a join.
