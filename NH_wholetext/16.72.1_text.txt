there is also a juice in the body of trees, which must be looked upon as their blood. it is not the same in all trees - in figs it is a milky substance, which has the property of curdling milk so as to produce cheese, in cherries it is gummy, in elms slimy, sticky and fat, in apples, vines and pears watery. the stickier this sap is, the longer the trees live. and in general the bodies of trees, as of other living things, have in them skin, blood, flesh, sinews, veins, bones and marrow. the bark serves for a skin; it is a remarkable fact as regards the bark on a mulberry that when doctors require its juice they strike it with a stone two hours after sunrise in spring and the juice trickles out, but if a deeper wound is made the bark seems to be dry. next to the bark most trees have layers of fatty substance, called from its white colour alburnum; this is soft and the worst part of the wood, rotting easily even in a hard oak and liable to woodworm, for which reason it will always be removed. under this fat is the flesh of the tree and under the flesh the bones, that is the best part of the timber. those trees which have a drier wood, for instance the olive, are more liable to bear fruit only every other year than trees whose wood is of a fleshy nature, like the cherry. and not all trees have a large amount of fat or flesh, any more than the most active among animals; there is no fat or flesh at all in the box, the cornel and the olive, nor any marrow, and only a very small quantity even of blood, just as the service-tree has no bones and the elder no flesh - though both have a great deal of marrow - nor have reeds for the greater part.
