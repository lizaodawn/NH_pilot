anagyros, which some call acopon, is bushy, with a strong smell and a flower like that of cabbage. the seed grows in little horn-like pods of some length; it is kidney-shaped and becomes hard during the harvests. the leaves are placed on gatherings, and tied as an amulet on women in difficult labour, care being taken to remove them immediately after delivery. but if a dead foetus does not come away, or if the afterbirth or menstruation is retarded, the leaves are taken in raisin-wine, a dose being a drachma. similar doses are given for asthma, and in old wine the leaves are given for the bites of poisonous spiders. the root is employed to disperse or mature boils; the seed chewed acts as an emetic.
