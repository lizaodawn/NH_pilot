the roman arms, for the first time, pursued their conquests into mauritania, under the emperor claudius, when the freedman aedemon took up arms to avenge the death of king ptolemy, who had been put to death by caius caesar; and it is a well-known fact, that on the flight of the barbarians our troops reached mount atlas. it became a boast, not only among men of consular rank, and generals selected from the senate, who at that time held the command, but among persons of equestrian rank as well, who after that period held the government there, that they had penetrated as far as mount atlas. there are, as we have already stated, five roman colonies in this province; and it may very possibly appear, if we listen only to what report says, that this mountain is easily accessible. upon trial, however, it has been pretty generally shown, that all such statements are utterly fallacious; and it is too true, that men in high station, when they are disinclined to take the trouble of inquiring into the truth, through a feeling of shame at their ignorance arc not averse to be guilty of falsehood; and never is implicit credence more readily given, than when a falsehood is supported by the authority of some personage of high consideration. for my own part, i am far less surprised that there are still some facts remaining undiscovered by men of the equestrian order, and even those among them who have attained senatorial rank, than that the love of luxury has left anything unascertained; the impulse of which must be great indeed, and most powerfully felt, when the very forests are ransacked for their ivory and citron-wood, and all the rocks of gaetulia are searched for the murex and the purple.
