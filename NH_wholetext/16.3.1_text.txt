because from it are obtained the civic wreaths, that glorious emblem of military valour, but now for a long time past also an emblem of the emperors clemency, ever since, owing to the impiety of the civil wars, not to kill a fellow-citizen had come to be deemed meritorious. below these rank mural crowns and rampart-crowns and also golden crowns, although surpassing them in cost, and below them likewise are beaked crowns, albeit down to the present supremely famous in the case of two persons, marcus varro who was given this honour by pompey [67 b.c.] the great as a result of the wars against the pirates, and likewise marcus agrippa who was awarded it is by augustus after the sicilian wars, which were also waged against pirates. previously the forum was graced by the rams of ships fastened in front of the platform, like a wreath crowning the roman nation. but later they began to be trampled on and polluted by the seditions of the tribunes, and power began to pass from public into private ownership, and to be sought for the advancement of individual citizens, and the sacrosanct tribunes began to make all things profane; and after this the rams passed from underneath the feet of the speakers to the heads of the citizens; this wreath of rams augustus bestowed upon agrippa, but he himself received the civic wreath from the whole of mankind.
