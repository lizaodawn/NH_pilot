at rome for a long time gold was actually not to be found at all except in very small amounts. at all events when peace had to be purchased after the capture of the city by the gauls, not more than [390 b.c.] a thousand pounds' weight of gold could be produced. i am aware of the fact that in pompey's third consulship [52 bc] there was lost from the throne of jupiter of the capitol two thousand pounds' weight of gold that had been stored there by camillus, which led to a general belief that 2000 pounds was the amount that had been accumulated. but really the additional sum was part of the booty taken from the gauls, and it had been stripped by them from the temples in the part of the city which they had captured â€” the case of torquatus shows that the gauls were in the habit of wearing gold ornaments in battle; therefore it appears that the gold belonging to the gauls and that belonging to the temples did not amount to more than that total; and this in fact was taken to be the meaning contained in the augury, when jupiter the god of the capitol had repaid twofold.
