there is also a bird of ill-omen called the fire-bird, on account of which we find in the annals that the city has often had a ritual purification, for instance in the consulship of lucius cassius and gaius marius [107 bce], in which year the appearance of an eagle-owl also occasioned a purification. what this bird was i cannot discover, and it is not recorded. some persons give this interpretation, that the fire-bird was any bird that was seen carrying a coal from an altar or altar-table; others call it a 'spinturnix,' but i have not found anybody who professes to know what particular species of bird that is. i also notice that the bird named by the ancients 'clivia' is unidentified â€” some call it 'screech-owl,' labeo 'warning owl'; and moreover a bird is cited in nigidius that breaks eagles' eggs. there are besides a number of kinds described in tuscan lore that have not been seen for generations, though it is surprising that they should have now become extinct when even kinds that are ravaged by man's greed continue plentiful.
