but if it bursts out of a larger cavern of downward pressing cloud but not so wide a one as in the case of a storm, and is accompanied by a crashing noise, this is what they call a whirlwind, which overthrows everything in its neighbourhood. when the same rages hotter and with a fiery flow, it is called a rester, as while sweeping away the things it comes in contact with it also scorches them up. but a typhoon does not occur with a northerly wind, nor a cloudburst with snow or when snow is lying. if it flared up as soon as it burst the cloud, and had fire in it, did not catch fire afterwards, it is a thunderbolt. it differs from a fiery pillar in the way in which a flame differs from a fire: a fiery pillar spreads out its blast widely, whereas a thunderbolt masses together its onrush. on the other hand a tornado differs from a whirlwind by returning, and as a whiz differs from a crash; a storm is different from either in its extent — it is caused by the scattering rather than the bursting of a cloud. there also occurs a darkness caused by a cloud shaped like a wild monster — this is direful to sailors. there is also what is called a column, when densified and stiffened moisture raises itself aloft; in the same class also is a waterspout, when a cloud draws up water like a pipe.
