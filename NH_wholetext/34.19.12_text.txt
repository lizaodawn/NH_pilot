alcamenes a pupil of pheidias made marble figures, and also in bronze a winner of the five bouts, known by the greek term meaning highly commended, but polycleitus's pupil aristides made four-horse and pair-horse chariots. amphicrates is praised for his leaena; she was a harlot, admitted to the friendship of harmodius and aristogeiton because of her skill as a harpist, who though put to the torture by the tyrants till she died refused to betray their plot to assassinate them. consequently the athenians wishing to do her honour and yet unwilling to have made a harlot famous, had a statue made of a lioness, as that was her name, and to indicate the reason for the honour paid her instructed the artist to represent the animal as having no tongue.
