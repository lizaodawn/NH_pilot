the first person who modelled a likeness in plaster of a human being from the living face itself, and established the method of pouring wax into this plaster mould and then making final corrections on the wax cast, was lysistratus of sikyon, the brother of lysippus of whom we have spoken. indeed he introduced the practice of giving likenesses, the object aimed at previously having been to make as handsome a face as possible. the same artist also invented taking casts from statues, and this method advanced to such an extent that no figures or statues were made without a clay model. this shows that the knowledge of modelling in clay was older than that of casting bronze.
