pepperwort also was originally an exotic. it is sown after the spring west wind starts, and then, when it has begun to shoot, it is cut down close to the ground and afterwards hoed and manured. subsequently the plant thus treated is serviceable for two years with the same shoots, provided it is not attacked by a severe winter, as it is very incapable of bearing cold. it grows to a height of as much as eighteen inches; it has the leaves of the bay-tree, but softer. it is always used mixed with milk.
