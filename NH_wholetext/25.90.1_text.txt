psyllion is called by some cynoides, by others chrystallion, by others sicelicon, and by others cynomyia; it has a slender root of no use in medicine, numerous twigs with grains like beans at the point, leaves not unlike a dog's head and seed not unlike a flea: hence too its name. the seed is in berries, and the plant itself is to be found in vineyards. its cooling and dispersing properties are very strong. the part used is the seed. for headache it is applied to the forehead and temples in vinegar and rose oil or in vinegar and water. for other purposes it is used as liniment. an acetabulum thickens and coagulates a sextarius of water; then it should be beaten up and the paste applied as liniment to any pain, gathering or inflammation. wounds in the head are healed by aristolochia, which also brings away fragments of bone in other parts of the body, but especially in the head; the same with plistolochia. thryselinum is not unlike celery. the root of it chewed clears away catarrhs of the head.
