armenia sends us the substance azarite, etc. named after it armenian. this also is a mineral that is dyed like malachite, and the best is that which most closely approximates to that substance, the colour partaking also of dark blue. its price used to be rated at 300 sesterces per pound. a sand has been found all over the spanish provinces that admits of similar preparation, and accordingly the price has dropped to as low as six denarii. it differs from dark blue by a light white glow which renders this blue colour thinner in comparison. it is only used in medicine to give nourishment to the hair, and especially the eyelashes.
