it is bad to plant an olive where an oak-tree has been dug up, because the worms called raucae breed in oak roots and go over to olives. it has been ascertained to pay better not to bury the cuttings in the ground or to dry them before they are planted. it has been found better for an old olive-yard to be raked over every other year between the spring equinox and the rising of the pleiades, and also to have the moss scraped off the trees, but for them to be dug round every year just after midsummer with a hole a yard across and a foot deep, and to be manured with dung every third year.
