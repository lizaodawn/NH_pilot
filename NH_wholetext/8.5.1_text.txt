it is remarkable in the case of most animals that they know why they are hunted, but also that almost all know what they must beware of. it is said that when an elephant accidentally meets a human being who is merely wandering across its track in a solitary place it is good-tempered and peaceful and will actually show the way; but that when on the other hand it notices a man's footprint before it sees the man himself it begins to tremble in fear of an ambush, stops to sniff the scent, gazes round, trumpets angrily, and avoids treading on the footprint but digs it up and passes it to the next elephant, and that one to the following, and on to the last of all with a similar message, and then the column wheels round and retires and a battle line is formed: since the smell in question lasts to be scented by them all, though in the majority of cases it is not even the smell of bare feet. similarly a tigress also, it is said, even though savage to all other animals and herself scorning the footprints even of an elephant, when she sees the track of a human being at once carries her cubs elsewhere. - though how has she recognized or where has she seen before the person that she fears? for it is certain that such forests are very little frequented. granted that no doubt they may be surprised by the mere rarity of the print; but how do they know that it is something to be afraid of? indeed there is a further point, why should they dread even the sight of a man himself when they excel him so greatly in strength, size and speed? doubtless it is nature's law and shows her power, that the fiercest and largest wild beasts may have never seen a thing that they ought to fear and yet understand immediately when they have to fear it.
