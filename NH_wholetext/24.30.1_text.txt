the power of the ash-tree to neutralize the poison of snakes i have already mentioned. the seed lies between its leaves which in wine are used for pains in the liver and sides, and draw off the subcutaneous water of dropsy. they lessen corpulence, gradually reducing the body to leanness. these leaves are also beaten up with wine in proportion to the strength of the body; for a child five leaves are soaked in three cyathi of wine, for stronger patients seven leaves in five cyathi. i must not forget the warning of some authorities, who declare that the shavings and sawdust of the ash are to be avoided.
