between the solstice and the setting of the lyre, on june 26 by caesar's reckoning, orion rises, and orion's belt on july 4, in the region of assyria, while in that of egypt in the morning rises the scorching constellation of procyon, which has no name with the romans, unless we take it to be the same as the little dog; it has a great effect in producing hot weather as we shall show a little later. on july 4 the crown sets in the morning for the people of chaldea and for attica the whole of orion rises on that day. on july 14 orion ceases rising for the egyptians, on july 17 procyon rises for assyria, and then three days later the great constellation recognized almost everywhere among all people, which. we call the rising of the dog-star, when the sun has entered the first quarter of the lion: this occurs on the 23rd day after midsummer. its rising influences both the seas and the lands, and indeed many wild animals, as we have said in the proper places; nor is this constellation less reverenced than the stars that are assigned to various gods; and it kindles the fire of the sun, and constitutes an important cause of the summer heat. on july 20 the eagle sets in the morning for egypt, and the breezes that herald the seasonal winds begin to blow, which in caesar's opinion is perceived in italy on july 23. the eagle sets for attica on the morning of that day, and the royal star in the breast of the lion rises, according to caesar, on the morning of july 30. on august 6 one-half of arcturus disappears; and on august 11 the setting of the lyre brings the beginning of autumn, according to caesar's note, but a true calculation has discovered that the date of this is really august 8.
