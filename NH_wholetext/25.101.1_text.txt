the cotyledon is a tiny plant on a tender little stem, with a very small fleshy leaf, which is concave like the hip joint. it grows in maritime and rocky places, fresh green in colour, and with a root that is oval like an olive. the juice is medicine for the eyes. there is another kind of cotyledon with dirty-green leaves, which are broader and closer together than those of the other, spread round the root as though it were an eye; the taste is very harsh, the stem longer than that of the other kind but very slender. it is used for the same purposes as the iris.
