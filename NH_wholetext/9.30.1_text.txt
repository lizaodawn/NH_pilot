of other fish of a good class the red mullet stands first in popularity and also in plentifulness, though its size is moderate and it but rarely exceeds 2 lbs. in weight, nor does it grow larger when kept in preserves and fishponds. this size is only produced by the northern ocean and in its westernmost part. for the rest, there are several kinds of mullet. for it feeds on seaweed, bivalves, mud and the flesh of other fish; and it is distinguished by a double beard on the lower lip. the mullet of cheapest kind is called the mud-mullet. this variety is always accompanied by another fish named sea-bream, and it swallows down as fodder mire stirred up by the sea-bream digging. the coast mullet also is not in favour. the most approved kind have the flavour of an oyster. this variety has the name of shoe-mullet, which fenestella thinks was given it from its colour. it spawns three times a year - at all events that is the number of times that its fry is seen. the leaders in gastronomy say that a dying mullet shows a large variety of changing colours, turning pale with a complicated modification of blushing scales, at all events if it is looked at when contained in a glass bowl. marcus apicius, who had a natural gift for every ingenuity of luxury, thought it specially desirable for mullets to be killed in a sauce made of their companions, garum - for this thing also has procured a designation - and for fish-paste to be devised out of their liver.
