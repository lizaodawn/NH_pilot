among the greeks indeed there have been written monographs on chaplets by mnesitheus and callimachus, physicians who specify what flowers are injurious to the head; for health is to a certain extent concerned even in this matter, because it is especially amid the gaiety of drinking parties that strong scents steal unawares to the head, witness the wicked cunning of cleopatra. for in the preparation for the war that culminated at actium, antonius, fearing even the attentiveness of the queen herself, would not take food that had not been foretasted. she is said to have played on his terror by poisoning the tips of the flowers in his chaplet, and then to have laid it on his head. presently, as the revelry grew wilder, she proposed as a challenge that they 'should drink their chaplets.' who in such circumstances would suspect treachery? so having gathered the fragments of his chaplet into his cup he was beginning to drink, when she laid on him an arresting hand, with these words: 'look, i am the woman, marcus antonius, against whom, with your new craze for foretasters, you are carefully on your guard. such my lack of opportunity or means to act if i can live without you!' then a prisoner was brought in and ordered by her to drink, who died on the spot. about flowers, besides the authors already mentioned, an account has been written by theophrastus among the greeks, and some of our own writers have composed books of anthologica. nobody has, however, followed up the subject of flowers fully, so far as i can discover. nor shall i now, of course, put chaplets together - for that would be mere trifling - but i shall include everything about flowers that will seem worthy of record.
