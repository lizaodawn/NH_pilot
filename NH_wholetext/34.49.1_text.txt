black lead which we use to make pipes and sheets is excavated with considerable labour in spain and through the whole of the gallic provinces, but in britain it is found in the surface-stratum of the earth in such abundance that there is a law prohibiting the production of more than a certain amount. the various kinds of black lead have the following names â€” oviedo lead, capraria lead, oleastrum lead, though there is no difference between them provided the slag has been carefully smelted away. it is a remarkable fact in the case of these mines only that when they have been abandoned they replenish themselves and become more productive. this seems to be due to the air infusing itself to saturation through the open orifices, just as a miscarriage seems to make some women more prolific. this was recently observed in the salutariensian mine in baetica, which used to be let at a rent of 200,000 denarii a year, but which was then abandoned, and subsequently let for 255,000. likewise the antonian mine in the same province from the same rent has reached a return of 400,000 sesterces. it is also remarkable that vessels made of lead will not melt if they have water put in them, but if to the water a pebble or quarter-as coin is added, the fire burns through the vessel.
