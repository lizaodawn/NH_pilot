and also something that looks like blood, and a fire that falls from it to the earth - the most alarming possible cause of terror to mankind; as happened in the third year [349bc] of the 107th olympiad, when king philip was throwing greece into disturbance. my own view is that these occurrences take place at fixed dates owing to natural forces, like all other events, and not, as most people think, from the variety of causes invented by the cleverness of human intellects; it is true that they were the harbingers of enormous misfortunes, but i hold that those did not happen because the marvellous occurrences took place but that these took place because the misfortunes were going to occur, only the reason for their occurrence is concealed by their rarity, and consequently is not understood as are the risings and setting of the planets described above and many other phenomena.
