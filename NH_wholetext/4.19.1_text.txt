the islands which lie before the lands already mentioned. lying opposite to thesprotia, at a distance of twelve miles from buthrotus, and of fifty from acroceraunia, is the island of corcyra, with a city of the same name, the citizens of which are free; also a town called cassiope, and a temple dedicated to jupiter cassius. this island is ninety-seven miles in length, and in homer has the names of scheria and phaeacia; while callimachus calls it drepane. there are some other islands around it, such as thoronos, lying in the direction of italy, and the two islands of paxos in that of leucadia, both of them five miles distant from corcyra. not far from these, and in front of corcyra, are ericusa, marathe, elaphusa, malthace, trachie, pythionia, ptychia, tarachie, and, off phalacrum, a promontory of corcyra, the rock into which (according to the story, which arises no doubt from the similarity of appearance) the ship of ulysses was changed.
