the syrtes: a third gulf is divided into two smaller ones, those of the two syrtes, which are rendered perilous by the shallows of their quicksands and the ebb and flow of the sea. polybius states the distance from carthage to the lesser syrtis, the one which is nearest to it, to be 300 miles. the inlet to it he also states to be 100 miles across, and its circumference 300. there is also a way to it by land, to find which we must employ the guidance of the stars and cross deserts which present nothing but sand and serpents. after passing these we come to forests filled with vast multitudes of wild beasts and elephants, then desert wastes, and beyond them the garamantes, distant twelve days' journey from the augylae. above the garamantes was formerly the nation of the psylli, and above them again the lake of lycomedes, surrounded with deserts. the augylae themselves are situate almost midway between aethiopia which faces the west, and the region which lies between the two syrtes, at an equal distance from both. the distance along the coast that lies between the two syrtes is 250 miles. on it are found the city of oea, the river cinyps, and the country of that name, the towns of neapolis, graphara, and abrotonum, and the second, surnamed the greater, leptis.
