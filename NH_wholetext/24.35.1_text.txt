the elder has a second, a much smaller species, growing wilder and called by the greeks chamaeacte, by others helion. a decoction in old wine of the leaves, seed, or root, of either species, taken as drink up to two cyathi for a dose, is bad for the stomach, though carrying off watery humours from the bowels. it also reduces inflammation, especially that of a recent burn, and a dog-bite is relieved by a poultice of its most tender leaves with pearl barley. an application of the juice softens gatherings on the brain, being specific when these are on the membrane that surrounds it. its berries have weaker properties than the other parts. they dye the hair. a dose of one acetabulum taken in drink is diuretic. the softest of the leaves are eaten with oil and salt to bring away phlegm and bile. for all purposes the smaller kind is the more efficacious. a decoction of the root in wine, taken in doses of two cyathi, draws off the water of dropsy; it also softens the uterus, as does also sitting in baths of a decoction of the leaves. the tender stalks of the cultivated elder boiled in a saucepan relax the bowels; the leaves taken in wine also counteract the bites of snakes.
