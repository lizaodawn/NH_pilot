but most miraculous and also frequent, are sudden deaths (this is life's supreme happiness), which we shall show to be natural. verrius has reported a great many, but we will preserve moderation with a selection. cases of people who died of joy are (besides chilo about whom we have spoken) sophocles and dionysius the tyrant of sicily, in both cases after receiving news of a victory with a tragedy: also the mother who saw her son back safe from cannae in contradiction of a false message; diodorus the professor of logic died of shame because he could not at once solve a problem put to him in jest by stilpo. cases of men dying from no obvious causes are: while putting on their shoes in the morning, the two caesars, the praetor and the ex-praetor, father of the dictator caesar, the latter dying at pisa and the former at rome; quintus fabius maximus on 31 december in the year of his consulship, in whose place gaius rebilus obtained the office for only a few hours; also the senator gaius volcatius gurges â€” all of these men so healthy and fit that they were thinking of going out for a walk; quintus aemilius lepidus who bruised his great toe in the doorway of his bedroom just as he was going out; gaius aufidius who after he had gone out hit his foot against something in the comitium when he was on his way to the senate. also an envoy who had pleaded the cause of rhodes in the senate to the general admiration, just as he wanted to leave the senate-house expired on the threshold; gnaeus baebius tamphilus, who had himself also held the praetorship, died just after asking his footman the time; aulus pompeius died on the capitol after paying reverence to the gods, mantis juventius thalna the consul while offering sacrifice, gaius servilius pansa while standing at a shop in the market-place, leaning on his brother publius's arm, at seven o'clock in the morning, baebius the judge while in the act of giving an order for enlargement of bail, marcus terentius corax while writing a note in the market-place; and moreover last year, a knight of rome died while saying something in the ear of an ex-consul, just in front of the ivory statue of apollo in the forum of augustus; and, most remarkable of all, the doctor gaius julius died from passing the probe through his eye while pouring in ointment, the ex-consul aulus manlius torquatus while helping himself to a cake at dinner, lucius tuccius, sulla's doctor, while drinking a draught of mead, appius saufeius when he had drunk some mead and was sucking an egg after coming back from the bathhouse, publius quintius scapula when out to dinner with aquilius gallus, decimus saufeius the clerk when lunching at home. cornelius gallus, expraetor, and titus hetereius knight of rome died while with women; and, cases remarked on by our own generation, two members of the order of knighthood died when with the same ballet-dancer mysticus, the leading beauty of the day. however, the most enviable case of a peaceful end is one recorded by our forefathers, that of marcus ofilius hilarus: he was an actor in comedy, and having had a considerable success with the public on his birthday and while giving a party, when dinner was served called for a hot drink in a tankard, and at the same time picked up the mask that he had worn on that day and while gazing at it transferred the wreath from his own head to it, and in this attitude lay quite stiff without anybody noticing, until the guest on the next couch warned him that his drink was getting cold.
