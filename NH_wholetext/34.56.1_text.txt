orpiment also is obtained from the same substance. the best is of a colour of even the finest-coloured gold, but the paler sort or what resembles sandarach is judged inferior. there is also a third class which combines the colours of gold and of sandarach. both of the latter are scaly, but the other is dry and pure, and divided in a delicate tracery of veins. its properties are the same as mentioned above, but more active. accordingly it is used as an ingredient in cauteries and depilatories. it also removes overgrowths of flesh on to the nails, and pimples in the nostrils and swellings of the anus and all excrescences. to increase its efficacy it is heated in a new earthenware pot till it changes its colour.
