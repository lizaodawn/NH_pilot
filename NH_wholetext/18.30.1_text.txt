the next subject is the nature of the leguminous plants, among which the highest place of honour belongs to the beau, inasmuch as the experiment has been made of using it for making bread. bean meal is called lomentum, and it is used in bread made for sale to increase the weight, as is meal made from all the leguminous plants, and nowadays even cattle fodder. beans are used in a variety of ways for all kinds of beasts and especially for man. with most nations it is also mixed with corn, and most of all with panic, for this purpose it is either used whole or broken up rather fine. moreover in ancient ritual bean pottage has a sanctity of its own in sacrifice to the gods. it occupies a high place as a delicacy for the table, but it was thought to have a dulling effect on the senses, and also to cause sleeplessness, and it was under a ban with the pythagorean system on that account - or, as others have reported, because the souls of the dead are contained in a bean, and at all events it is for that reason that beans are employed in memorial sacrifices to dead relatives. moreover according to varro's account it is partly for these reasons that a priest abstains from eating beans, though also because certain letters of gloomy omen are to be found inscribed on a bean-flower. there is also a special religious sanctity attached to the bean; at all events it is the custom to bring home from the harvest a bean by way of an auspice, this being consequently called the harvest-home bean. also it is supposed to bring luck at auctions if a bean is included in a lot for sale. it is undoubtedly the case that the bean is the only grain that even when it has been grazed down by cattle fills out again when the moon is waxing. it cannot be thoroughly boiled in sea water or other water with salt in it.
