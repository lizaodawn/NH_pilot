the first foundations are termed by experts commosis, the second pissoceros, the third propolis, between the outer cover and the wax, substances of great use for medicaments. commosis is the first crust, of a bitter flavour. pissoceros comes above it, as in laying on tar, as being more fluid than wax. propolis is obtained from the milder gum of vines and poplars, and is made of a denser substance by the addition of flowers, and though not as yet wax it serves to strengthen the combs; with it all approaches of cold or damage are blocked, and besides it has itself a heavy scent, being in fact used by most people as a substitute for galbanum.
