for brain-fever appears to be beneficial, a sheep's lung wrapped warm round the patient's head. but who could give to one delirious the brain of a mouse to be taken in water, or the ash of a weasel, or even the dried flesh of a hedgehog, even if the treatment were bound to be successful? as for the eyes of the horned owl reduced to ash, i should be inclined to count this remedy as one of the frauds with which magicians mock mankind, and it is especially in fevers that true medicine is opposed to the doctrines of these quacks. for they have actually divided the art according to the passing of the sun, and also that of the moon, through the twelve signs of the zodiac. that the whole theory should be rejected i will show by a few examples. if the sun is passing through gemini, they recommend the sick to be rubbed with the combs, ears, and claws of cocks, burnt and pounded with oil; if it is the moon, the cocks' spurs and wattles must be used. if either sun or moon is passing through virgo, grains of barley must be used; if through sagittarius, a bat's wings; if the moon is passing through leo, leaves of tamarisk, and they add that it must be the cultivated shrub; if through aquarius, boxwood charcoal, pounded. of these remedies i shall include only those recognised, or at least thought probable: for example, to rouse the victims of lethargus by pungent smells, among which perhaps i would put the dried testicles of a weasel or the fumes of his burnt liver. for these patients also they consider it useful to wrap round the head the warm lung of a sheep.
