but having discussed medicines from flowers, garland and garden, as well as herbs which are chewed, how can i possibly omit medicines from cereals? indeed it would be fitting to mention these as well. in the first place it is a well known fact that those animals that feed on grain are the most intelligent. grains of common wheat well roasted and then crushed, applied in aminean wine to the eyes soothe fluxes; moreover, well roasted on an iron plate grains of naked wheat are a quick remedy for frostbite. the flour of naked wheat boiled in vinegar is good for cramp; the bran moreover and rose oil, dried figs and sebesten plums, all boiled down, make a good gargle for tonsils and throat. sextus pomponius, father of a man who was praetor, himself the most distinguished man in nearer spain, was superintending the winnowing in his barns when he was seized with the pains of gout. burying himself above his knees into the wheat he was relieved of the pain, and the water in his feet dried up in a wonderful way, so that afterwards he adopted this procedure as a remedy. the absorbent power of wheat is so great that it dries up casks full of liquid. experienced authorities also prescribe the chaff of wheat or barley to be applied warm for hernia, and the water in which it has been boiled to be used for fomentations. there is to be found in emmer-wheat a little worm like the woodworm. if this be plugged with wax into the hollow of a decayed tooth, it is said that the tooth comes out, or even if the affected part be rubbed with it. olyra (two-grained wheat) is, as i have said, also called arinca. with a decoction of it a medicine is made which the egyptians call athera, very beneficial for babies, though adults too use it as a liniment.
