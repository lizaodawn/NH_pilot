the cave-dweller country and the thebaid and arabia where it separates judea from egypt all alike have the myrobalanum, which is grown for scent, as is shown by its name itself, which also indicates in addition that it is a nut; it is a tree with a leaf that resembles that of the heliotrope, which we shall describe among the herbaceous plants, and a fruit the size of a hazel-nut. the variety growing in arabia is called the syrian nut, and is white in colour, whereas the thebaid kind is black; the former is preferred for the excellent quality of the oil extracted from it, but the thebaic for its large yield. the cave-dweller kind is the worst among the varieties. some persons prefer to these the ethiopian behen, which has a black oily nut and a slender kernel, but the liquid squeezed out of it has a stronger scent; it grows in level districts. it is said that the egyptian nut is even more oleaginons and has a thicker shell of a reddish colour, and that though it grows on marshy ground the plant is shorter and drier, whereas the arabian variety, on the contrary, is green in colour and also smaller in size and more compact in shape because it likes mountain regions; but the petraean kind, coming from the town mentioned above, is a long way the best - it has a black rind and a white kernel. perfumiers, however, only extract the juice from the shells, but medical men also crush the kernels, gradually pouring warm water on them while pounding them.
