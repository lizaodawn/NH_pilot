during nero's principate there was discovered in cappadocia a stone as hard as marble, white and, even where deep-yellow veins occurred, translucent. in token of its appearance it was called 'phengites' or the 'luminary stone.' of this stone nero rebuilt the temple of fortune, known as the shrine of sejanus, but originally consecrated by king servius tullius and incorporated by nero in his golden house. thanks to this stone, in the daytime it was as light as day in the temple, even when the doors were shut; but the effect was not that of windows of specular stone, since the light was, so to speak, trapped within rather than allowed to penetrate from without. according to juba, there exists in arabia too a stone that is transparent like glass, and is used as window panes.
