ceratia, a plant with one leaf, and a large, knotted root, taken in food cures sufferers from coeliac disease and dysentery. leontopodium, called by some leuceoron, by others dorypetron, by others thorybethron, is a plant the root of which, in doses of two denarii by weight added to hydromel, checks looseness of the bowels and carries off bile. it grows on flat land with a thin soil. its seed, taken in drink, is said to cause nightmares. lagopus taken in wine, or in water if there is fever, checks looseness of the bowels. it is also attached to the groin when there is swelling there. it grows in cornfields. many recommend above all else for desperate cases of dysentery doses of a decoction in milk of the roots of cinquefoil, or aristolochia, a victoriatus by weight in three cyathi of wine. when the prescriptions mentioned above are to be taken warm, it will be found best to heat them with red-hot iron. on the other hand a drachma of the juice of the lesser centaury taken in a hemina of water with a little salt and vinegar purges the bowels and carries off bile; the greater centaury dispels griping pains. betony acts as an aperient, four drachmae being added to nine cyathi of hydromel; so also euphorbeum or agaric, in doses of two drachmae with a little salt, taken in water or in three oboli of honey wine. cyclamen too is an aperient, either taken in water or used as a suppository; the same in its action is a suppository of chamaecissos. a handful of hyssop, boiled down to one third with salt, or pounded in oxymel and salt, both carries off phlegm and expels worms from the intestines. root of peucedanum carries off both phlegm and bile.
