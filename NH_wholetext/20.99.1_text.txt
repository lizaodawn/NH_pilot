we have also spoken in our description of garden plants of the cultivation of thistles, and so we should not put off a discussion of their medical value. of wild thistles there are two kinds: one being more bushy as soon as it leaves the earth, the other is thicker, but has only one stem. both kinds have only a few leaves, prickly and with pointed heads, but the latter puts forth in the middle of its points a purple flower, that quickly turns white and is gone with the wind; the greeks call it σκόλυμος. if this kind be pounded and compressed before it flowers, an application of the juice restores skin and hair lost by mange. the root of any kind boiled in water is said to create thirst in those who are drunkards. it strengthens the stomach, and, if we may believe the report, it also affects the womb in such a way that male children are engendered. glaucias, at any rate, who seems to have been a most careful student of thistles, put this statement on record. a gum-like mastich coming from thistles makes the breath sweet.
