in regard to cinnamomum and casia a fabulous story has been related by antiquity, and first of all by herodotus, that they are obtained from birds' nests, and particularly from that of the phoenix, in the region where father liber was brought up, and that they are knocked down from inaccessible rocks and trees by the weight of the flesh brought there by the birds themselves, or by means of arrows loaded with lead; and similarly there is a tale of casia growing round marshes under the protection of a terrible kind of bats that guard it with their claws, and of winged serpents — these tales having been invented by the natives to raise the price of their commodities. however, there goes with them a story that under the reflected rays of the sun at midday an indescribable sort of collective odour is given off from the whole of the peninsula, which is due to the harmoniously blended exhalation of so many kinds of vapour, and that the first news of arabia received by the fleets of alexander the great was carried by these odours far out to sea — all these stories being false, inasmuch as cinnamomum, which is the same thing as cinnamon, grows in ethiopia, which is linked by intermarriage with the cave-dwellers. the latter buy it from their neighbours and convey it over the wide seas in ships that are neither steered by rudders nor propelled by oars or drawn by sails, nor assisted by any device of art: in those regions only man and man's boldness stands in place of all these things. moreover they choose the winter sea about the time of the shortest day, as an east wind is then chiefly blowing. this carries them on a straight course through the bays, and after rounding a cape a west-north-west wind brings them to the harbour of the gebbanitae called ocilia. on this account that is the port most resorted to by these people, and they say that it is almost five years before the traders return home and that many perish on the voyage. in return for their wares they bring back articles of glass and copper, clothing, and buckles, bracelets and necklaces; consequently that traffic depends principally on having the confidence of the women.
