the laurel itself is a bringer of peace, inasmuch as to hold out a branch of it even between enemy armies is a token of a cessation of hostilities. with the romans especially it is used as a harbinger of rejoicing and of victory, accompanying despatches and decorating the spears and javelins of the soldiery and adorning the generals' rods of office. from this tree a branch is deposited in the lap of jupiter the all-good and all-great whenever a fresh victory has brought rejoicing, and this is not because the laurel is continually green, nor yet because it is an emblem of peace, as the olive is to be preferred to it in both respects, but because it flourishes in the greatest beauty on mount parnassus and consequently is thought to be also dear to apollo, to whose shrine even the kings of rome at that early date were in the custom of sending gifts and asking for oracles in return, as is evidenced by the case of brutus; another reason also is perhaps to supply a token, because it was there that brutus won freedom for the people by kissing the famous plot of earth that bore the laurel, at the direction of the oracular utterance; and another possible reason is that the laurel alone of all the shrubs planted by man and received into our houses is never struck by lightning. i personally am inclined to believe that it is for these reasons that the place of honour has been assigned to it in triumphs, rather than because it was employed, as masurius records, for the purpose of fumigation and purification from the blood of the enemy. and it is so strongly forbidden to pollute the laurel and the olive in profane uses, that they must not be employed even for kindling a fire at altars and shrines in propitiating the deities. the laurel indeed manifestly expresses objection to the application of fire by crackling and making a solemn protest, the timber actually giving a twist to the cracks in its intestines and sinews. it is stated that the emperor tiberius used to put a wreath from this tree on his head when there was a thunder-storm as a protection against danger from lightning.
