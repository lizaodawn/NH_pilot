among these is a fourth genus, the silk-moth, which occurs in assyria; it is larger than the kinds mentioned above. silk-moths make their nests of mud like a sort of salt; they are attached to a stone, and are so hard that they can scarcely he pierced with javelins. in these nests they make combs on a larger scale than bees do, and then produce a bigger grub.
