to ptisan, which is prepared from barley, hippocrates devoted a whole volume, lavishing on it praises which today are all given instead to alica, a far more wholesome preparation. hippocrates however praises ptisan for its merits as a broth, because (as he says) being lubricant it is easily swallowed, quenches thirst, does not swell in the belly, is easily evacuated, and is the only food that can be given twice a day to those fever patients who are in the habit of taking two meals, so different is hippocrates from those, who treat their patients with a starvation diet. however he forbids the broth to be swallowed whole, or any part of it other than the juice; he says also that it must never be given so long as the feet are cold; indeed that then no drink of any kind should be given. ptisan can also be made from wheat, when it is more viscous and more beneficial to an ulcerated trachea.
