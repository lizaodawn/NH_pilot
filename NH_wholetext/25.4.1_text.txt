besides these the subject has been treated by greek writers, whom we have mentioned in their proper places; of these, crateuas, dionysius and metrodorus adopted a most attractive method, though one which makes clear little else except the difficulty of employing it. for they painted likenesses of the plants and then wrote under them their properties. but not only is a picture misleading when the colours are so many, particularly as the aim is to copy nature, but besides this, much imperfection arises from the manifold hazards in the accuracy of copyists. in addition, it is not enough for each plant to be painted at one period only of its life, since it alters its appearance with the fourfold changes of the year.
