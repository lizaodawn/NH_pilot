it is the obstinacy of our authorities that compels me to speak next of lyncurium, since, even when they refrain from asserting that this lyncurium is amber, they still claim that it is a gemstone, stating that it is formed indeed from the urine of the lynx, but also from a particular kind of earth. they say that the creature, bearing a grudge towards mankind, immediately conceals its urine, which forms a stone in the same place. the stone is said to have the same fiery colour as amber, to be capable of being engraved and to attract not merely leaves or straws, but also shavings of copper and iron, a belief which even theophrastus accepts on the authority of a certain diocles. i for my part am of the opinion that the whole story is false and that no gemstone bearing this name has been seen in our time. also false are the statements made simultaneously about its medical properties, to the effect that when it is taken in liquid it breaks up stone in the bladder, and that it relieves jaundice if it is swallowed in wine or even looked at.
