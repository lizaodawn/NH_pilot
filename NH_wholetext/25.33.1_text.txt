clymenus is a plant called after the king of that name. it has leaves like those of ivy, many branches, a hollow stem girded with joints, a strong smell, and seed like that of ivy; it grows in wooded, hilly districts. i shall say later what diseases it cures if taken in drink; but at the moment i must point out that, while it cures, even men are made sterile by the draught. the greeks have said that it is like the plantain, with a square stem and seed-bags intertwined like the tentacles of the polypus. the juice too is used in medicine, as it has very great powers of cooling.
