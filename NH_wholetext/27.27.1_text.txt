ampelos agria is a name given to a plant with hard leaves of an ashy colour, as i have described in my account of cultivated trees. it has long, hard-skinned twigs, of a red colour like the blossom we call flame of jupiter. it bears in little clusters seed like pomegranate pips. its root, boiled down in three cyathi of water with the addition of two cyathi of coan wine, is a gentle aperient, and therefore is given to dropsical patients. the clusters remove the spots on women's faces. sciatica too is relieved by this plant ground up with the leaves and applied with its own juice.
