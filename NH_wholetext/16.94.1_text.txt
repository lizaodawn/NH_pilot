mistletoe berries can be used for making bird-lime, if gathered at harvest time while unripe; for if the rainy season has begun, although they get bigger in size they lose in viscosity. they are then dried and when quite dry pounded and stored in water, and in about twelve days they turn rotten - and this is the sole case of a thing that becomes attractive by rotting. then after having been again pounded up they are put in running water and there lose their skins and become viscous in their inner flesh. this substance after being kneaded with oil is bird-lime, used for entangling birds' wings by contact with it when one wants to snare them.
