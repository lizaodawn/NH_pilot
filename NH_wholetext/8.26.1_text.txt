the east pastures camels among its flocks of cattle; of these there are two kinds, the bactrian and the arabian, which differ in that the former have two humps on the back and the latter one, with a second hump beneath the chest on which they can rest their weight; but both kinds resemble oxen in having no teeth in the upper jaw. all however perform the services of beasts of burden, and also of cavalry in battles; their speed is below that of horses. but the two kinds differ in dimensions, as also in strength; and a camel will not travel beyond its customary march, nor carry more than the regulation load. they possess an innate hatred for horses. they can endure thirst for as much as four days, and when they have an opportunity they replenish themselves both for the past interval and for the future, stirring up the water by trampling with their fore feet before they drink â€” otherwise they do not enjoy the draught. they live for fifty years, some even for a hundred; although even camels are liable to rabies. a method has been discovered of gelding even the females intended for war; this by denying them intercourse increases their strength.
