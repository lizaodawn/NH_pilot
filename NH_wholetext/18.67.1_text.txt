she had already formed the remarkable group of the pleiades in the sky; yet not content with these she has made other stars on the earth, as though crying aloud: 'why gaze at the heavens, husbandman? why, rustic, search for the stars? already the slumber laid on you by the nights in your fatigue is shorter. lo and behold, i scatter special stars for you among your plants, and i display them to you in the evening and as you unyoke to leave off work, and i stimulate your attention by a marvel so that you may not be able to pass them by: do you see how their fire-like brilliance is screened by their folded wings, and how they carry daylight with them even in the night? i have given you plants that mark the hours, and in order that you may not even have to avert your eyes from the earth to look at the sun, the heliotrope and the lupine revolve keeping time with him. why then do you still look higher and scan the heavens themselves? lo! you have pleiades at your very feet.' glow-worms do not make their appearance on fixed days or last a definite period, but certain it is that they are the offspring of this particular constellation. consequently anybody who does his summer sowing before they appear 'will have himself to thank for labour wasted.' in this interval also the little bee comes forth and announces that the bean is flowering, and the bean begins to flower to tempt her out. we will also give another sign of cold weather being ended: when you see the mulberry budding, after that you need not fear damage from cold.
