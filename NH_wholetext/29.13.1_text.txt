as in this book i am going to treat of the very useful goose egg, and of the goose itself, our respects are due to the famous preparation called commagenum. it is made from goose grease, a very popular medicament everywhere, [and for this purpose especially in commagene, a district of syria] with cinnamon, cassia, white pepper, and the herb called cornmagene. the mixture is put into vessels and buried in snow; it has a pleasant smell, and is very useful for chills, sprains, blind or sudden pains, and for all the complaints treated by anodynes being equally good as an ointment and as a medicine. it is also prepared in syria in another way. the grease of the birds is treated in the manner i shall describe, and there are added to it erysisceptrum, balsam-wood, ground palm, and also crushed reed, the same quantity of each as of the grease, the whole being warmed two or three times in wine. but it must be prepared in winter, for it will riot set in summer unless wax is added. there are many other remedies made from the goose, which surprise me as much as the many from the goat, for the goose and the crow are said to be afflicted with disease from the beginning of summer well into the autumn.
