in egypt also grows the caper-tree, a shrub with a rather hard wood; also its seed is well known as an article of food, and is usually gathered together with the stalk. its foreign varieties should be avoided, inasmuch as the arabian kind is poisonous and the african injures the gums, and that from marmarica, is injurious to the womb. also the apulian caper-tree produces vomiting and diarrhoea by causing flatulence in all the organs. some persons call this shrub 'dog-brier,' others 'snake-vine'.
