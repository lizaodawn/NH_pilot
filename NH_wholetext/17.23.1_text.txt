from this has been derived the process of inoculation, consisting in opening an eye in a tree by cutting away the bark with a tool resembling a shoemaker's punch and enclosing in it a seed that has been removed from another tree by means of the same tool. this was the method of inoculation used in old days in the case of figs and apples; but the method described by virgil is to find a recess in a knot of bark burst open by a shoot and to enclose in this a bud obtained from another tree.
