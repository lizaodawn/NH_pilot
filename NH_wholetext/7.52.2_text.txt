also varro records that when he was acting as one of the twenty commissioners and apportioning lands at capua a person being carried out on a bier to burial returned home on foot; and that the same thing occurred at aquinum; and that also at rome his maternal aunt's husband corfidius came to life again after his funeral had been arranged for with an undertaker, and that he himself superintended the funeral of the relative who had made the arrangement. he adds some marvellous occurrences that it would be suitable to have set out in their entirety: that there were two brothers corfidius, of the rank of knights, to the elder of whom it happened that he appeared to have expired, and when his will was opened the younger brother was read out as his heir, and set about arranging his funeral; in the meantime the brother who appeared to be dead summoned the servants by clapping his hands and told them that he had come from his brother, who had entrusted his daughter to his care, and had also shown him where he had without anybody's knowledge hidden some gold in a hole dug in the ground, and had asked that the preparations that he had made for his brother's funeral might be used for himself. while he was telling this story his brother's servants hurriedly came with the news that their master was dead; and the gold was found in the place where he had said. moreover life is full of these prophecies, but they are not worth collecting, because more often than not they are false, as we will prove by an outstanding example. in the sicilian war the bravest man in caesar's navies gabienus was taken prisoner by sextus pompeius, by whose order his throat was cut and almost severed, and so he lay a whole day on the shore. then on the arrival of evening, a crowd having been gathered to the spot by his groans and entreaties, he besought that pompey should come to him, or send one of his personal staff, as he had come back from the lower world and had some news to tell him. pompey sent several of his friends, who were told by gabienus that the gods below approved pompey's cause and the righteous party, so that the issue would be what pompey desired; that he had had orders to bring this news, and that a proof of its truth would be that as soon as his errand was accomplished he would expire. and this so happened. there are also cases of persons appearing after burial â€” save that our subject is the works of nature, not prodigies.
