scythia: leaving the ister, we come to the towns of cremniscos, aepolium, the mountains of macrocremnus, and the famous river tyra, which gives name to a town on the spot where ophiusa is said formerly to have stood. the tyragetae inhabit a large island situate in this river, which is distant from pseudostomos, a mouth of the ister, so called, 130 miles. we then come to the axiacae, who take their name from the river axiaces, and beyond them, the crobyzi, the river rhodes, the sagarian gulf, and the port of ordesos. at a distance of 120 miles from the tyra is the river borysthenes, with a lake and a people of similar name, as also a town in the interior, at a distance of fifteen miles from the sea, the ancient names of which were olbiopolis and miletopolis. again, on the shore is the port of the achaei, and the island of achilles, famous for the tomb there of that hero, and, at a distance of 125 miles from it, a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword, in an oblique direction, and is called, from having been his place of exercise, achilleos dromos: the length of this, according to agrippa, is eighty miles. the taurian scythians and the siraci occupy all this tract of country.
