wonderful too appear to me the characters of fishes given by ovid in his book entitled halieuticon: how the scarus, caught in a weel, does not burst out to the front, or thrust his head through the osiers that imprison him, but turns round, widens the gaps with repeated blows of his tail, and so creeps backwards. if by chance his struggles are seen by another scarus outside, he seizing the other's tail with his teeth helps the efforts to burst out. the basse, he says, when surrounded by a net, ploughs a hole in the sand with his tail, and so is buried until the net passes over him. he says too that the murena, knowing that his back is rounded and slippery, attacks the meshes themselves, and then by involved wriggling widens them until he escapes; that the polypus attacks the hook, grips it with his tentacles, not teeth, and does not let it go before he has nibbled round the bait, or been lifted out of the water by the rod. the mugil too knows that in the bait is a hook, and is quite aware of the trap; his greed however is so great that by lashing with his tail he knocks off the food. the basse has less cunning insight, but great strength when he realizes his mistake. for when caught on the hook he dashes about wildly, widening the wounds until the snare is torn out. the murena swallows more than the hook, applies the line to his teeth, and so gnaws it through. ovid also relates that the anthias, when the hook catches, turns over, since on his back is a spine with a knife-edge, with which he cuts through the line.
