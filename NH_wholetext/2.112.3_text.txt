these are the facts that i consider worth recording in regard to the earth's length and breadth. its total circumference was given by bratosthenes (an expert in every refinement of learning, but on this point assuredly an outstanding authority - i notice that he is universally accepted) as 252,000 stades, a measurement that by roman reckoning makes 31,500 miles - an audacious venture, but achieved by such subtle reasoning that one is ashamed to be sceptical. hipparchus, who in his refutation of eratosthenes and also in all the rest of his researches is remarkable, adds a little less than 26,000 stades.
