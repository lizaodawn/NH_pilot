it grows in a light sandy soil and for the most part in one containing nitrates. it likes running water, and to drink all the year round, though it loves dry places. some people think that dung actually does it harm, while a section of the assyrians think that this happens if they do not mix the dung with water from a stream. there are several kinds of palm, beginning with kinds not larger than a shrub — a shrub that in some cases is barren, though in other districts it too bears fruit — and having a short branch. in number of places this shrub-palm with its dome of leaves serves instead of plaster for the walls of a house, to prevent their sweating. also the taller palms make a regular forest, their pointed foliage shooting out from the actual tree all round them like a comb — these it must be understood are wild palms, though they also have a wayward fancy for mingling among the cultivated varieties. the other kinds are rounded and tall, and have compact rows of knobs or circles in their bark which render them easy for the eastern races to climb; they put a plaited noose round themselves and round the tree, and the noose goes up with the man at an astonishingly rapid speed. all the foliage is at the top of the tree, and so is the fruit, which is not among the leaves as in all other trees, but hanging in bunches from shoots of its own between the branches, and which has the nature of both a cluster and a single fruit. the leaves have a knife-like edge at the sides and are divided into two flanges that fold together; they first suggested folding tablets for writing, but at the present day they are split up to make ropes and plaited wickerwork and parasols.
