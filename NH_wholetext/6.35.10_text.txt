beyond is the region of sirbitum, at which the mountains terminate, and which by some writers is said to contain the maritime aethiopians, the nisacaethae, and the nisyti, a word which signifies "men with three or four eyes," â€” not that the people really have that conformation, but because they are remarkable for the unerring aim of their arrows. on that side of the nile which extends along the borders of the southern ocean beyond the greater syrtes, dalion says that the people, who use rain-water only, are called the cisori, and that the other nations are the longompori, distant five days' journey from the oecalices, the usibalci, the isbeli, the perusii, the ballii, and the cispii, the rest being deserts, and inhabited by the tribes of fable only. in a more westerly direction are the nigroae, whose king has only one eye, and that in the forehead, the agriophagi, who live principally on the flesh of panthers and lions, the pamphagi, who will eat anything, the anthropophagi, who live on human flesh, the cynamolgi, a people with the heads of dogs, the artabatitae, who have four feet, and wander about after the manner of will beasts; and, after them, the hesperiae and the perorsi, whom we have already spoken of as dwelling on the confines of mauritania. some tribes, too, of the aethiopians subsist on nothing but locusts, which are smoke-dried and salted as their provision for the year; these people do not live beyond their fortieth year.
