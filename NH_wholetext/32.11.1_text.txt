coral is as valuable among the indians as indian pearls, about which i have spoken in their proper place, are among the romans, for cost varies with the demand of any particular people. coral is also found in the red sea, but this is of a darker colour; also in the persian gulf — this is called lace — the most valued is in the gallic gulf around the stoechades islands, in the sicilian gulf around the aeolian islands, and around drepana. coral also grows at graviseae and before naples in campania; but that at erythrae, which is very red indeed, is soft and therefore thought worthless.
