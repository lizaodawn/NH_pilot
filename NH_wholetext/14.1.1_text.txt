so far we have been dealing mostly with foreign trees that cannot be trained to grow elsewhere than in their place of origin and that refuse to be naturalized in strange countries. we may now speak of those common to various countries, of all of which italy can be thought to be the special parent. only it must be remembered by the student that for the present we are specifying their natures and not their modes of cultivation, although actually a very large factor in the nature of a tree is due to its cultivation. there is one thing at which i cannot sufficiently wonder — that of some trees the very memory has perished, and even the names recorded by authors have passed out of knowledge. for who would not admit that now that intercommunication has been established throughout the world by the majesty of the roman empire, life has been advanced by the interchange of commodities and by partnership in the blessings of peace, and that even things that had previously lain concealed have all now been established in general use? still, it must be asserted, we do not find people acquainted with much that has been handed down by the writers of former days: so much more productive was the research of the men of old, or else so much more successful was their industry, when a thousand years ago at the dawn of literature hesiod began putting forth rules for agriculture, and not a few writers followed him in these researches — which has been a source of more toil to us, inasmuch as nowadays it is necessary to investigate not only subsequent discoveries but also those that had already been made by the men of old, because general slackness has decreed an utter destruction of records.
