the fourth kind is the panaces discovered by the same chiron and surnamed centaurion, but also phamaceon, a name derived from king pharnaces, as there is a controversy whether he was, or was not, the discoverer. this kind is grown from seed, having longer leaves than the other kinds, and with serrated edges. its scented root is dried in the shade, and adds a pleasing taste to wine. some hold that there are two other kinds of panaces, one with a broad, the other with a slender, leaf.
