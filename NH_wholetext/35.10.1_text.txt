his late lamented majesty augustus went beyond all others, in placing two pictures in the most frequented part of his forum, one with a likeness of war and triumph, and one with the castors and victory. he also erected in the temple of his father caesar pictures we shall specify in giving the names of artists. he likewise let into a wall in the curia which he was dedicating in the comitium: a nemea seated on a lion, holding a palm-branch in her hand, and standing at her side an old man leaning on a stick and with a picture of a two-horse chariot hung up over his head, on which there was an inscription saying that it was an encaustic design — such is the term which he employed — by nicias. the second picture is remarkable for displaying the close family likeness between a son in the prime of life and an elderly father, allowing for the difference of age: above them soars an eagle with a snake in its claws; philochares has stated this work to be by him showing the immeasurable power exercised by art if one merely considers this picture alone, inasmuch as thanks to philochares two otherwise quite obscure persons glaucio and his son aristippus after all these centuries have passed still stand in the view of the senate of the roman nation! the most ungracious emperor tiberius also placed pictures in the temple of augustus himself which we shall soon mention. thus much for the dignity of this now expiring art.
