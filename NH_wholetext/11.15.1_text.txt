honey is obtained more copiously at full moon, and of thicker substance in fine weather. in all honey the portion that has flowed by itself like must and olive oil — it is called honey-vinegar — is the most commendable. all summer honey is reddish, as it has been made in a comparatively dry period. white honey is not made where there is thyme, but honey made from thyme is thought most suitable for the eyes and for ulcers — it is of a gold colour and has an extremely agreeable taste. the fat honey from violets and the thick kind from rosemary can be seen to condense, but honey that thickens is least praised. honey from thyme does not condense, and when touched sends out very thin threads, which is the first proof of goodness; it is considered a mark of poor quality for the drops to break off at once and fall back. the next test is for it to have a fragrant scent and a sweet taste leaving a tang, and to be sticky and transparent. cassius dionysius holds that a tenth part of the summer honey-crop should be left to the bees, if the hives were full, and that if they were not, a proportionate amount should be left, or if they were empty, they should not be touched at all. the population of attica have given the first ripening of the wild fig as the regnal for this vintage, but others say vulcan's holy day.
