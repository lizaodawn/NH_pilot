another name used for the purple is 'pelagia.' there are several kinds, distinguished by food and the ground they live on. the mud-purple feeds on rotting slime and the seaweed-purple on seaweed, both being of a very common quality. a better kind is the reef-purple, collected on the reefs of the sea, though this also is lighter and softer as well. the pebble-purple is named after a pebble in the sea, and is remarkably suitable for purple dyes; and far the best for these is the melting-purple, that is, one fed on a varying kind of mud. purples are taken in a sort of little lobster-pot of fine ply thrown into deep water. these contain bait, cockles that close with a snap, as we observe that mussels do. these when half-killed but put back into the sea gape greedily as they revive and attract the purples, which go for them with outstretched tongues. but the cockles when pricked by their spike shut up and nip the creatures nibbling them. so the purples hang suspended because of their greed and are lifted out of the water.
