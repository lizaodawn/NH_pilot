the nature of storax also i have spoken of in my account of foreign trees. in addition to the qualities there mentioned, the most esteemed kind is very rich, unadulterated, and breaks up into white fragments. it cures coughs, affections of the throat, chest diseases, and obstructions or indurations of the uterus; by the mouth or as a pessary it acts as an emmenagogue; it loosens the bowels. i find in my authorities that a moderate dose dispels melancholy, but that a larger one causes it; that an injection cures singing in the ears, a local application scrofulous sores and knotty lumps on the sinews. it counteracts poisons that harm by chilling, and therefore, among others, hemlock.
