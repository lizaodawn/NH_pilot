among water creatures ought also to be mentioned calamochnus, the latin name of which is adarca. it collects around thin reeds from the foam forming where fresh and sea water mingle. it has a caustic property, and is therefore useful for tonic pills and to cure cold shiverings. it also removes freckles on the face of women. at the same time reeds should be spoken of. the root of phragmites, pounded fresh, cures dislocations, and applied with vinegar pains in the spine; the cyprian reed indeed, also called donax, has a bark which when calcined cures mange and chronic ulcers, and its leaves extract things embedded in the flesh, and help erysipelas. the flower of the reed panicula causes complete deafness if it has entered the ears. the ink of the cuttlefish has so great power that anaxilaus reports that poured into a lamp the former light utterly vanishes, and people appear as black as ethiopians. a bramble toad thoroughly boiled in water and given to drink cures pigs' diseases, as does the ash of any frog or toad. if wood is thoroughly rubbed with pulmo marinus it seems to be on fire, so much so that a walking-stick, so treated, throws a light forward.
