in shape coral is like a shrub, and its colour is green. its berries are white under the water and soft; when taken out they immediately harden and grow red, being like, in appearance and size, to those of cultivated cornel. it is said that at a touch it immediately petrifies, if it lives; and that therefore it is quickly seized and pulled away in nets or cut off by a sharp iron instrument. in this way they explain its name 'coral.' the most valued coral is the reddest and most branchy, without being rough or stony, or again empty and hollow. coral berries are no less valued by indian men than are large indian pearls by roman women. indian soothsayers and seers think that coral is a very powerful amulet for warding off dangers. accordingly they take pleasure in it both as a thing of beauty and as a thing of religious power. before the indian love of coral became known, the gauls used to ornament with coral their swords, shields, and helmets. at the present day it has become so scarce because of the price it will fetch that it is very rarely to be seen in the countries where it grows. branches of coral, worn as an amulet by babies, are believed to be protective, and reduced to powder by fire and taken with water are helpful in gripings, bladder trouble and stone; similarly, taken in wine, or, if fever is present, in water, coral is soporific. coral resists fire for a long time, but they say also that taken in drink repeatedly as medicine it consumes the spleen. the ash of coral branches is good treatment for bringing up or spitting of blood. it is a component of eye salves, for it is astringent and cooling, fills up the hollows of ulcers, and smoothes out scars.
