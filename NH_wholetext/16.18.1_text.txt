the pitch-pine loves mountains and cold localities. it is a funereal tree, and is placed at the doors of houses as a token of bereavement and grown on graves; nevertheless nowadays it has also been admitted into our homes because of the ease with which it can be clipped into various shapes. this pine gives out a quantity of resin interspersed with white drops so closely resembling frankincense that when mixed with it they are indistinguishable to the eye; hence the adulteration is practised in the seplasia. all these classes of trees have short leaves, but rather thick and hard like the leaf of the cypress. the branches of the pitch-pine are of moderate size and grow out almost immediately from the root of the tree, attached to its sides like arms.
