'schistos' and haematite are closely related. haematite is found in mines, and when roasted reproduces the colour of red-lead. it is roasted in the same way as the phrygian stone, except that it is not quenched with wine. it can be counterfeited, but genuine haematite is distinguished by its occurrence as red veins and by its friable character. it is extraordinarily good for bloodshot eyes, and checks excessive menstruation if it is taken as a draught. it is drunk also, with pomegranate juice added, by patients who have brought up blood. a draught of it is an effective remedy for bladder trouble; moreover, if it is taken in wine it is an antidote for snakebites. all these properties exist, but in a weaker form, in the substance known as 'schistos.' among its varieties, the more suitable is like saffron in colour. mixed with human milk it is a specific for filling cavities left by sores. it is also admirable for reducing protruding eyes. such is the consensus of opinion among the most recent writers.
