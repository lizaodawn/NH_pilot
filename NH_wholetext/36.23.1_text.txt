in the same city is the so-called runaway stone (lapis fugitivus), which the argonauts used as an anchor and left there. this has frequently strayed from the prytaneum (this being the name of the place where it is kept), and so it has been fastened with lead. in this city too, close to the so-called thracian gate, there are seven towers that repeat with numerous reverberations any sounds that strike upon them. the greek term for this remarkable phenomenon is 'echo.' it is caused of course by the configuration of the landscape and generally of deep valleys; but at cyzicus it occurs by pure chance, while at olympia it is produced artificially in a remarkable manner within the portico known as 'the heptaphonon [seven voices],' so called because the same sound re-echoes seven times. at cyzicus, moreover, there is a large building called the bouleuterium, the rafters of which have no iron nails and are so arranged that beams can be removed and replaced without scaffolding. this is the case also with the sublician bridge in rome, where there has been a solemn ban on the use of nails ever since it was torn down with such difficulty while horatius cocles was defending it.
