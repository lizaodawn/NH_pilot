a third variety is tithymalon, called by some mecon, by others paralion, with a leaf like that of flax, a white flower, and a head of the size of a bean. it is gathered when the grape is at its best and then dried in the shade. its seed, taken in half an acetabulum of honey wine, purges the bowels. but the head of any poppy, whether fresh or dried, if applied to the eyes relieves fluxes. opium taken in nearly neat wine, if administered immediately, is an antidote for the stings of scorpions. some give this property only to the dark variety, if its heads or leaves be pounded up.
