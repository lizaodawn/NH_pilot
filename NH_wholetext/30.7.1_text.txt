it should be unique evidence of fraud that they look upon the mole of all living creatures with the greatest awe, although it is cursed by nature with so many defects, being permanently blind, sunk in other darkness also, and resembling the buried dead. in no entrails is placed such faith; to no creature do they attribute more supernatural properties; so that if anyone eats its heart, fresh and still beating, they promise powers of divination and of foretelling the issue of matters in hand. they declare that a tooth, extracted from a living mole and attached as an amulet, cures toothache. the rest of their beliefs about this animal i will relate in the appropriate places. but of all they say nothing will be found more likely than that the mole is an antidote for the bite of the shrewmouse, seeing that an antidote for it, as i have said, is even earth that has been depressed by cart wheels.
