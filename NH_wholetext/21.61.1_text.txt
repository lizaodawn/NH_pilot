eared plants are yet another kind, to which belong achynops, alopecuros, stelephuros — by some called ortyx, by others plantago, about which i shall speak more fully in the section on medicinal plants — and thryallis. of these alopecurus has a soft ear and thick down, not unlike the tail of a fox; hence too its name. stelephuros is very like it, except that it blossoms bit by bit. chicory and the plants like it have leaves near the ground, budding from the root after the pleiades.
