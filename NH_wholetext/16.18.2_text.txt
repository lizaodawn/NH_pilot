similarly the fir, which is in great demand for building ships, grows high up on mountains, as though it had run away from the sea; and its shape is the same as that of the pitch-pine. but it supplies excellent timber for beams and a great many of the appliances of life. resin, which gives its value to the pitch-pine, is a defect in the fir, which occasionally exudes a small quantity when exposed to the action of the sun. the wood, on the contrary, which in the case of the fir is extremely beautiful, in the pitch-pine only serves for making split roof-shingles and tubs and a few other articles of joinery.
