silver was first coined in the 485th year of the city. [269-8 bc] in the consulship of quintus ogulnius and gaius fabius, five years before the first punic war. it was decided that the value of a denarius should be ten pounds of bronze, that of a half-denarius five pounds, that of a sesterce two pounds and a half. the weight of a standard pound of bronze was however reduced during the first punic war, when the state could not meet its expenditure, and it was enacted that the as should be struck weighing two ounces. this effected a saving of five sixths, and the national debt was liquidated. the design of this bronze coin was on one side a janus facing both ways and on the other the ram of a battleship; the third of an as and the quarter as had a ship. the had previously been called a teruncius, as weighing three ounces. subsequently when the presence of hannibal was being felt, in the dictator [217 bc] ship of quintus fabius maximus, asses of one ounce weight were coined, and it was enacted that the exchange-value of the denarius should be sixteen asses, of the half-denarius eight and of the quarter-denarius four; by this measure the state made a clear gain of one half. but nevertheless in the pay of soldiers one denarius has always been given for ten asses. the designs on silver were a two-horse and a four-horse chariot, and consequently the coins were called a pair of horses and a four-in-hand.
