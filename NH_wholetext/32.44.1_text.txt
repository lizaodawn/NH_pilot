creeping ulcers and the excrescences that form in them are checked by ash of menae or of the silurus, carcinomata by heads of salted perch, with more effect if with their ash are mixed salt and headed cunila, and the whole kneaded with oil. the ash of a sea crab that has been burnt with lead checks carcinomata. for this purpose river crab too suffices with honey and fine lint. some prefer to mix alum and honey with the ash. phagedaenic ulcers are healed by silurus kept till stale and beaten up with sandarach; malignant ulcers, corrosive ulcers, and festering sores by old tunny sliced; the maggots that breed in them are removed by frogs' gall. fistulas are opened and dried up by salted fish inserted with lint; within two days such fish remove all callus, festering sores, and creeping ulcers, if kneaded up as for a plaster and applied. allex also applied in strips of lint cleans sores; likewise the shell of sea-urchins, reduced to ash. carbuncles are dispersed if treated with salted coracinus. likewise with the ash of salted red mullet - some use the head only with honey - or with the flesh of coracinus. ash of murex with oil removes swellings, and the gall of the sea scorpion sears.
