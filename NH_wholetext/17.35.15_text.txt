the main branch should have two or three buds below the cross-bar from which wood may be produced, and then it should be stretched out along the bar and tied to it, so as to be held up by it, not to hang down from it, and then after the third bud it should be fastened more tightly to it by means of a tie, because that also has the effect of restraining the outgrowth of the wood and causing a more abundant outburst of shoots short of the tie; but it is forbidden to tie the end of the main branch. the nature of the vine is that the part hanging down or bound with a ligature yields fruit, and most of all the actual curve of the branch, but that which is short of the ligature makes wood, i suppose because the vital spirit and the pith mentioned above meets an obstacle. the woody shoot so produced will bear fruit in the following year. thus there are two kinds of main branches; the shoot which comes out of the hard timber and promises wood for the next year is called a leafy shoot a or else when it is above the scar a fruit-bearing shoot, whereas the other kind of shoot that springs from a year-old branch is always a fruit-bearer. there is also left underneath the cross-bar a shoot called the keeper — this is a young branch, not longer than three buds, which will provide wood next year if the vine's luxurious growth has used itself up — and another shoot next to it, the size of a wart, called the pilferer, is also left, in case the keeper-shoot should fail.
