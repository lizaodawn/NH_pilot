among these artists the following remarkable case is not to be left out; the man who ground the colours for the painter nealces, erigonus, attained such proficiency on his own account that he actually left behind him a famous pupil, pasias, the brother of the painter aiginetas. it is also a very unusual and memorable fact that the last works of artists and their unfinished pictures such as the iris of aristides, the tyndarus' children of nicomachus, the medea of timomachus and the aphrodite of apelles which we have mentioned, are more admired than those which they finished, because in them are seen the preliminary drawings left visible and the artists' actual thoughts, and in the midst of approval's beguilement we feel regret that the artist's hand while engaged in the work was removed by death.
