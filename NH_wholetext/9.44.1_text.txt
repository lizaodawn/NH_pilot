we will now speak of the bloodless fishes. of these there are three kinds: first those which are called soft fish, then those covered with thin rinds, and lastly those enclosed in hard shells. the soft are the cattle-fish, the sepia, the polyp and the others of that kind. they have the head between the feet and the belly, and all of them have eight little feet. in the sepia and cuttle-fish two of these feet are extremely long and rough, and by means of these they carry food to their months, and steady themselves as with anchors in a rough sea; but all the rest are feelers which they use for catching their prey.
