the right amounts of seed per acre to sow in soil of medium quality are: bare or common wheat 5 pecks, emmer or seed (the kind of grain to which we give that name) 10; barley 6, beans a fifth more than in the ease of wheat, vetch 12, chick-pea, chickling vetch and peas 3, lupine 10, lentil 3 (but it is considered desirable to sow lentils mixed with dry dung), fitch 6, fenugreek 6, calavances 4, hay-grass 20, common and italian millets a quarter of a peck, or more in a rich soil and less in a thin one. there is also another distinction to make: in thick or chalky or moist soil 6 pecks of bare or common wheat, but in loose and dry and fertile soil 4; for a meagre soil makes a small and empty ear unless it has the corn stalks far apart, whereas fields with a rich soil produce a number of stalks from a single seed and yield a thick crop from thinly scattered seed. consequently the rule given is to sow between four and six pecks, adding or subtracting a fifth in accordance with the nature of the soil, and the same in a densely planted place or on sloping land as in thin soil. to this applies that oracular utterance, which it is so important to observe: 'do not grudge the cornfield its seed.' to this attius in his praxidike added the advice to sow when the moon is in the constellations of the ram, the twins, the lion, the scales and aquarius, but zoroaster advised sowing when the sun has crossed 12 degrees of the scorpion and the moon is in the bull.
