also thorn-wood is equally esteemed in the same country, that is, the wood of a black thorn, as it lasts without decaying even in water, and is consequently extremely serviceable for the ribs of ships; timbers made of a white thorn rot easily. it has sharp thorns even on the leaves, and seed in pods that is used instead of oak-galls in dressing leather. the blossom has a pleasing effect in garlands and also makes a valuable medicine; also the tree distils gum. but its most valuable property is that when cut down it shoots up again two years later. this thorn grows in the neighbourhood of thebes, where oak, persea and olive are also found, in a forest region nearly 40 miles from the nile, watered by springs that rise in it. this region also contains the egyptian plum-tree, which is not unlike the thorn last mentioned; its fruit resembles a medlar, and ripens in the winter, and the tree is an evergreen. the fruit contains a large stone, but the fleshy part, owing to its nature and to the abundance in which it grows, provides the natives with quite a harvest, as after cleaning it they crush it and make it into cakes for storage. there was also once a forest region round memphis with such huge trees that three men could not join hands round the trunks; and one of them was particularly remarkable, not because of its fruit or its utility for some purpose, but on account of the circumstance that it has the appearance of a thorn, but leaves resembling wings, which when somebody touches the branches at once fall off and afterwards sprout again.
