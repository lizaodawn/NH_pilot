storms and rain obviously have some regular causes, but some that are accidental, or at all events not hitherto explained. for who can doubt that summer and winter and the yearly vicissitudes observed in the seasons are caused by the motion of the heavenly bodies? therefore as the nature of the sun is understood to control the year's seasons, so each of the other stars also has a force of its own that creates effects corresponding to its particular nature. some are productive of moisture dissolved into liquid, others of moisture hardened into frost or coagulated into snow or frozen into hail, others of a blast of air, others of warmth or heat, others of dew, others of cold. but it must not be thought that the stars are of the size that they appear to the sight, since the consideration of their immense altitude proves that none of them is smaller than the moon. consequently each of them exercises its own nature in its own motion, a fact which the transits of saturn in particular make clear by their storms of rain. nor does this power belong to the moving stars only, but also to many those that are fixed to the sky, whenever they are impelled forward by the approach of the planets or goaded on by the impact of their rays, as we observe occurring in the case of the little pigs, the greek name for which is consequently the hyades, a word denoting rain. indeed some stars move of themselves and at fixed times - compare the rising of the kids. but the rising of the constellation arcturus is almost always accompanied by a hail-storm.
