the same properties are to be found in hypericon — some call it chamaepitys, others conssum — which has the stem of a garden vegetable, thin, reddish, and a cubit high. the leaves are like those of rue and have a pungent smell. the seed, which is black, is in a pod, and it ripens at the same time as barley. this seed is of a bracing quality, checks diarrhoea and promotes urine; it is taken with wine for bladder troubles.
