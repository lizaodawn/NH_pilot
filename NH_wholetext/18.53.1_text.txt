a very important part of this topic is occupied by the proper way of using dung, about which we have also spoken in the preceding volume. the one thing known to everybody is that the land must not be sown unless it has been manured, although even this matter has special rules applying to it. you must not sow millet, panic, turnip or navew except in ground that has been manured, but if the ground has not been manured, you should sow wheat in it rather than barley. similarly also in the case of fallows, although it is held that in these beans should be sowed, in every case you must sow that crop after the soil has been manured as recently as possible. a person intending to sow something in the autumn should pile dung on the land in september, at all events after rain has fallen; but if intending to sow in the springtime, he should spread dung during the winter - eighteen loads of dung is the proper amount to be given to an acre; but be careful not to spread it before ploughing. but after the seed has been sown, if this manuring has been neglected, the following stage is, before you weed, first to scatter like seed some dust of droppings obtained from hen-coops. but to fix a precise limit for this treatment also, the right amount is to get one load of manure per head of smaller animals and ten loads per head of oxen. if that be not forthcoming, it would look as if the farmer had been slack in providing litter for his stock. some people think that manuring is best done by keeping the flocks and herds permanently out of doors penned up with netting. if the land is not manured it gets chilled, and if it is given too much manure it becomes burnt up; and it pays better to do the manuring frequently than to manure to excess. it stands to reason that the warmer the soil is the less manure it should be given.
