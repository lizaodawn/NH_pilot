that all this has taken place in spite, as it were, of the earth, is manifested by the existence of so many straits and such numbers of narrow passages formed against the will of nature — that of the hellespont, being only eight hundred and seventy-five paces in width, while at the two bosphori (west and east) the passage across may be effected by oxen swimming, a fact from which they have both derived their name. and then besides, although they are thus severed, there are certain points on which these coasts stand in the relation of brotherhood towards each other — the singing of birds and the barking of dogs on the one side can be heard on the other, and an intercourse can be maintained between these two worlds by the medium even of the human voice, if the winds should not happen to carry away the sound thereof.
