theophrastus tells us that a spring of marsyas in phrygia, near the town of celaenae, casts out rocks. not far from it are two springs, named claeon and gelon, so called from the force of their greek names. a spring at cyzicus is called cupid's spring; those who drink of it, mucianus believes, lose their amorous desires.
