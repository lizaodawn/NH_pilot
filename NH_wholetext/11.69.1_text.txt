the heart with the other animals is in the middle of the chest, but in man alone it is below the left breast, with its conical end projecting forward. in fishes only it points towards the mouth. it is stated that at birth the heart is the first organ formed in the womb, and next the brain, just as the eyes develop latest, but that the eyes are the first to die and the heart the last. the heart is the warmest part. it has a definite beat and a motion of its own as if it were a second animal inside the animal; it is wrapped with a very soft and firm covering of membrane, and protected by the wall of the ribs and chest, so that it may give birth to the principle cause and origin of life. it provides the vital principle and the blood with their primary abodes inside it, in a winding recess which in large animals is three-fold and in all others without exception double; this is the dwelling-place of the mind. from this source two large veins run apart to the front and the back of the body, and diffuse the blood of life through other smaller veins with a spreading system of branches to all the limbs. the heart alone is not tortured by the defects of the inner organs; and it does not prolong the torments of life, and when wounded at once brings death. when the rest of the parts have been injured vitality continues in the heart.
