it is the nature of the chick-pea to contain an element of saltness, and consequently it scorches the soil, and ought not to be sown without having been soaked the day before. there are several varieties differing in size, colour, shape and flavour. one resembles a ram's head and so is called 'ram's chick-pea'; of this there is a black variety and a white one. there is also the dove-pea, another name for which is venus's pea, bright white, round, smooth and smaller than the ram's chick-pea; it is used by religious ritual in watch-night services. there is also the chickling vetch, belonging to a diminutive variety of chick-pea, uneven in shape and with corners like a pea. but the chick-pea with the sweetest taste is one that closely resembles the bitter vetch; the black and red varieties of this are firmer than the white.
