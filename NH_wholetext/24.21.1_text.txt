for a like reason honourable mention shall be made of pityusa also, which some include in the same class as tithymalus. it is a shrub like the pitch-pine, with a small, purple flower. bile and phlegm are earned off in the stools by a decoction of the root, the dose being one hemina, and by suppositories made of a spoonful of the seed. a decoction of the leaves in vinegar removes scaly eruptions on the skin and, mixed with a decoction of rue, is good for affections of the breasts, for griping pains, for snake bites and for gatherings in general in their early stages.
