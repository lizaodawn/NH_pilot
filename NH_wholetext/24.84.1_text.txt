the chamaecissos ('ground ivy') is a plant with ears like those of wheat, with about five little branches and many leaves. when in blossom it might be taken for the white violet. the root is slender. for sciatica three oboli of the leaves are taken in two cyathi of wine for seven days, but it is a very bitter draught.
