but the greeks have also other kinds of clematis, one of which some call aetites, others lagioe, and others the 'slender scammony.' it has branches two feet long, leafy, and not unlike those of scammony, except that the leaves are darker and smaller. it is found in vineyards and cultivated fields, is eaten as salad with oil and salt, and relaxes the bowels. with linseed it is also drunk in a dry wine by sufferers from dysentery. the leaves with pearl barley are applied to fluxes from the eyes, a damp rag being first placed underneath. an application draws scrofulous sores to suppuration, and then a further application with axle-grease completes the cure. with green oil also they are beneficial for haemorrhoids, and with honey for consumptives. taken as a food they also promote an abundant supply of human milk, applied to the heads of babies they stimulate the growth of hair, and eaten with vinegar. they act as an aphrodisiac.
