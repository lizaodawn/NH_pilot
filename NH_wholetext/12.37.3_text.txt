it is also stated that there is a ladanum shrub in garmania and beyond egypt, where plants of it were introduced through the agency of the ptolemies, or, as others say, it is a throwback from the incense-tree; and that it is collected like gum by making a cut in the bark and received in goatskin sacks. the most highly approved kind is sold at a price of 40 asses a pound. it is adulterated with myrtle berries and with filth from the fleeces of other animals beside the goat. when genuine it ought to have a fierce scent, somehow suggesting the smell of the desert, and though looking dried up it should soften immediately to the touch, and when set light to flare up with an agreeable scent; but when adulterated with myrtle-berries it can be detected by its unpleasant smell, and it crackles in the fire. moreover, the genuine ladanum has dust or rather bits of stone from the rocks clinging to it.
