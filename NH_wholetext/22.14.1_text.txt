hippophaes grows on sandy soils and by the sea. it has pale thorns, and clusters, like those of ivy, with berries partly white and partly red. its root is rich in a juice which is either dispensed by itself or made up into lozenges with vetch meal. an obolus by weight carries off bile, most healthfully if taken with honey wine. there is another hippophaes, consisting only of very small leaves without stem or flower. the juice of this also is wonderfully good for dropsy. they must be well suited to the constitution of horses too, and must also have received their name for this and no other reason. the fact is that certain plants are created to be remedies for the diseases of animals, the deity being bounteous in producing protections for them, so that it is impossible to admire enough his wisdom, which arranges the aids according to the type of disease, the cause of it, and its season. each period of the year has its own appropriate remedy, and scarcely can any be found that is without its safeguards.
