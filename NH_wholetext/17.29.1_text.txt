we shall best convey in cato's own words the rules that he judged necessary to keep in looking after olives: 'make the olive slips that you are going to plant in the hole a yard long, and handle them carefully so as not to damage the bark when cutting or trimming them. make those you are going to plant in the nursery a foot long. plant them thus: the place must be first dug over with a mattock and have the soil well loosened; when you put the slip in, press down the slip with your foot; if it does not go down far enough, drive it in with a mallet or a beetle, and be careful not to break the bark while you are driving it in. do not make a hole beforehand with a dibble into which to put the slip: if you do not, it will live better. the slips do not mature till three years old, when the bark will turn. if you plant them in holes or in furrows, put them in groups of three and keep these apart. cheek just by the eye that they do not project more than four fingers' breadth above the earth. â€” in taking up an olive tree you should use great care and carry the roots with as much earth as possible; when you have well covered up the roots, tread them down well, so that nothing may injure them. if anyone asks what is the time for planting an olive, the answer is, where there is a dry soil, at seed-time, but where it is rich, in the spring.
