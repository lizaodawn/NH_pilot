the remaining plants of a cartilaginous nature are all hidden in the ground. among these, we might appear to have already spoken amply about the turnip, were it not that medical men class the round plants in this group as being of the male sex and the more spread out and curved ones as female, the latter being superior in sweetness and easier to store; though after being repeatedly sown they turn into male plants. the same authorities have made four classes of navews, the corinthian, kleonaian, liothasian and boeotian, the last also called merely the green turnip. of these the corinthian turnip grows to a very large size, with its root almost bare, for only this kind grows upward, not down into the ground as the others do. the liothasian kind is by some called thracian navew; it stands cold extremely well. the boeotian navew is sweet, and also is remarkable for its short round shape, not being elongated like the kleonaian variety. in fact, generally speaking, navews the leaves of which are smooth also themselves have a sweeter taste, and those with rough and angular and bristly leaves are more bitter. there is also a wild kind the leaves of which resemble colewort. at rome the prize is given to the turnips of amiternum, and next to those of nursia, and the third place to the local variety. the rest of the facts about growing navews have been stated in the passage dealing with turnips.
