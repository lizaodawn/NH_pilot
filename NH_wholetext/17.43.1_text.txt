and to a large extent the medical treatment of trees resembles that of human beings, as the bones of trees also are treated by perforation. bitter almonds are made into sweet ones if the stem of the tree has the earth dug away round it and a ring of holes pierced in it at the bottom, and then the gum exuding is wiped off. also elms can be relieved of useless sap by having holes pierced in them above the level of the earth right into the cambium when they are getting old, or when they are observed to be receiving excessive nourishment. the sap is also discharged from the bark of figs when swollen by means of light cuts made on a slant; this treatment prevents the fruit from falling off. fruit-trees that make buds but produce no fruit are treated by making a cleft in the root and inserting a stone in it, and this makes them bear; and the same result is produced in almonds by driving in a wedge of hard oak, and in pears and service-berries by means of a wedge of stone pine, and covering up the hole with ashes and earth. it also pays to cut round the roots of vines and figs when over-luxuriant and to put ashes on the cut parts. late figs are produced if those of the first crop are picked off the tree still unripe, when they are a little larger than a bean, as a second crop grows which ripens later. also fig-trees are made stronger and more productive if the tips of all the branches are docked when they begin to make foliage. the object of the process that employs the gall-insect from the wild fig is to ripen the fruit.
