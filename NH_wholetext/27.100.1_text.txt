phyllon is the name given by the greeks to a plant that grows on rocky heights. the female is more grass-green in colour than the male, with a slender stem and a small root. the seed is like the round seed of a poppy. this kind causes births of its own sex, the male those of males, differing from the female merely in its seed, which resembles that of the olive when it is just beginning to form. both kinds are taken in wine.
