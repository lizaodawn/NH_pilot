the following also is acute advice: 'in a rather thin soil crops should be sown that do not need much moisture, for instance tree-medick, and such of the leguminous plants, except chick-pea, as are gathered by being pulled up out of the ground and not by being cut - which is the reason why they are called "crops", because that is how they are "cropped" - but in rich land the plants that need greater nutriment, such as greens, wheat, common wheat, flax. under this method consequently thin soil will be assigned to barley, as its root demands less nourishment, while more easily worked and denser earth will be allotted to wheat. in a rather damp place emmer will be sown in preference to other wheat, but in soil of medium quality this and also barley. hillsides produce a stronger wheat but a smaller crop of it. emmer and common wheat can do with both chalky and marshy soil.'
