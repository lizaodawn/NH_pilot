glycyside, called by some paeonia or pentorobon, has a stem two spans high; two or three others go with it. this stem is reddish, with bark like that of bay; the leaves resemble those of isatis, only more fleshy, rounder, and smaller. the seed is in pods, with some grains red, some black. there are however two kinds of the plant. the one to the roots of which are attached about six or eight rather long bulbs like acorns is regarded as female. the male has no more bulbs, since it is supported only by a single root, a span deep, white, and astringent to the taste. the leaves of the female smell of myrrh, and are closer together. the plants grow in woods. it is said that they should be dug up by night, because to do so in the daytime is dangerous, for the woodpecker called 'bird of mars' assaults the eyes. that there is a danger, however, of prolapsus of the anus when a root is being dug up, i hold to be a very fraudulent lie, calculated to exaggerate the real facts. these plants are of manifold use. the red grains check red menstrual discharge, about fifteen being taken in dark-red wine. the black grains are healing to the uterus, the same number being taken in raisin or ordinary wine. the root in wine relieves all pains of the belly, opens the bowels, cures opisthotonic tetanus, jaundice, and complaints of the kidneys and bladder; for the trachea and the stomach however a decoction in wine is used, which also acts astringently on the bowels. it is eaten too as a food, but as a medicine four drachmae are enough. the black grains, taken in wine to the number mentioned, also prevent nightmares, while for stomach ache and for gnawing colic it is beneficial both to eat them and to apply them locally. suppurations too are dispersed, recent by the black seed and old by the red. both kinds are good for snakebites, and to cure stone in children when strangury is beginning.
