in the past there was a strong preference for the wine of surrentum, followed by one for alban or falernian; after that various choices have been popular, each man — so unreasonable are we in our judgments — dictating to everybody else a preference for what he himself finds most pleasant; and yet even with uniformity of opinion how small a part of mankind could make use of these kinds of wine. today indeed not even our nobility ever enjoys wines that are genuine. so low has our commercial honesty sunk that only the names of the vintages are sold, the wines being adulterated as soon they are poured into the vats. accordingly, strange indeed as the remark may seem, the more common a wine is today, the freer it is from impurities. nevertheless, the opinions of the wines we have mentioned seem on the whole the best maintained. if anyone lays stress also on the test of age, that falernian is wholesome which is neither new nor too old; its middle age begins when it is fifteen years old. taken as a cold draught it is good for the stomach, but in hot water it is not. for chronic cough and likewise for quartan ague it is swallowed with benefit neat and on an empty stomach. no other wine quickens so much the action of the veins. astringent to the bowels it puts flesh on the body. it is a firm belief that this wine injures the vision and is not beneficial to nerves or to the bladder. alban wines are better for the nerves, the sweet ones less so to the stomach, while the dry are even more beneficial than the falernian. they aid digestion less and tend to overload the stomach, but the wines of surrentum have no such bad effects, nor do they go to the head, while they check catarrhs of the stomach and intestines. caecuban wines are no longer produced.
