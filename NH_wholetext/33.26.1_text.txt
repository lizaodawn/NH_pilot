gold-solder is a liquid found in the shafts we spoke of, flowing down along a vein of gold, solder. with a slime that is solidified by the cold of winter even to the hardness of pumice-stone. a more highly spoken of variety of the same metal has been ascertained to be formed in copper mines, and the next best in silver-mines. a less valuable sort also with an element of gold is also found in lead mines. in all these mines however an artificial variety is produced that is much inferior to the natural kind referred to; the method is to introduce a gentle flow of water into the vein all winter and go on till the beginning of june and then to dry it off in june and july, clearly showing that gold-solder is nothing else than the putrefaction of a vein of metal. natural gold-solder, known as 'grape,' differs very greatly from the artificial in hardness, and nevertheless it also takes a dye from the plant called yellow-weed. it is of a substance that absorbs moisture, like flax or wool. it is pounded in a mortar and then passed through a fine sieve, and afterwards milled and then sifted again with a finer sieve, everything that does not pass through the sieve being again treated in the mortar and then milled again. the powder is all along separated off into bowls and steeped in vinegar so as to dissolve all hardness, and then is pounded again and then rinsed in shells and left to dry. then it is dyed by means of splittable alum and the plant above mentioned and so given a colour before it serves as a colour itself. it is important how absorbent it is and ready to take the dye; for if it does not at once catch the colour, scytanum and turbistum must be added as well â€” those being the names of two drugs producing absorption.
