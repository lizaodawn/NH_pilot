as for lime, cato the censor disapproves of preparing it from variegated limestone, for white limestone produces a better quality. lime made from a hard stone is more effective for walling, while that made from porous limestone is more suitable for plastering. lime manufactured from silex is condemned for both purposes. again, it is more serviceable if it is produced from quarried stone than from stones collected on the banks of rivers. a superior kind is made from stones used for querns, for they have a certain unctuous character. lime possesses one remarkable quality: once it has been burnt, its heat is increased by water.
