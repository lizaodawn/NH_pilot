but the breadth of the earth from the south point to the north is calculated by isidorus as less by about one half, 5,462 miles, showing how much the heat has abstracted on one side and the cold on the other. as a matter of fact i do not think that there is this reduction in the earth, or that it is not the shape of a globe, but that the uninhabitable parts on either side have not been explored. this measurement runs from the coast of the ethiopic ocean, where habitation just begins, to meroe 705 miles, thence to alexandria, 1,250, rhodes 584, cnidus 86 1/2, cos 25, samos 100, chios 94, mitylene 65, tenedos 49, cape sigeum 12 1/2, bosphorus 312 1/2, cape carambis 350, mouth of lake maeotis 312 1/2, mouth of the tanais 266, - a route that by cutting down the crossings can be shortened. from the mouth of the tanais to the canopic mouth of the nile the most careful authorities have made the distance 2,110 miles. artemidorus thought that the regions beyond had not been explored, though admitting that the tribes of the sarmatae dwell round the tanais to the northward. isidorus added 1,250 miles right on to thule, which is a purely conjectural estimate. i understand that the territory of the sarmatae is known to an extent not less than the limit just stated. and from another aspect, how large is the space bound to be that is large enough to hold innumerable races that are continually migrating? this makes me think that there is an uninhabitable region beyond of much wider extent; for i am informed that beyond germany also there are vast islands that were discovered not long ago.
