the 'daphnea,' or 'laurel stone,' is prescribed by zoroaster as a cure for epilepsy. the 'diadochos,' or 'substitute,' resembles beryl. the 'diphyes' is a stone of twofold character. it is subdivided into a black and a white, a male and a female variety, each of the two varieties bearing an outline that distinctively portrays the organ of its sex. the 'dionysias,' or 'stone of dionysus,' a hard stone, the colour of which is black intermingled with red spots, produces the flavour of wine when it is ground to powder and mixed with water, and is supposed to be an antidote to drunkenness. the 'draconitis,' otherwise known as 'dracontias,' the 'snake stone,' is obtained from the brains of snakes, but unless the head is cut off from a live snake, the substance fails to turn into a gem, owing to the spite of the creature as it perceives that it is doomed. consequently, the beast's head is lopped off while it is asleep. sotacus, who writes that he saw such a gem in the possession of a king, states that those who go in search of it ride in two-horsed chariots, and that when they see the snake they scatter sleeping-drugs and so put it to sleep before they cut off its head. according to him, the stone is colourless and transparent, and cannot subsequently be polished or submitted to any other skilful process.
