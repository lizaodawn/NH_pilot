the idaean bramble was so called because no other grows on mount ida. it is, however, more delicate than other brambles and smaller, with the canes farther apart and less prickly; it grows under the shade of trees. the blossom of it with honey is applied to fluxes of the eyes and to erysipelas, and in water it is given as a drink to patients with disordered stomachs; its other properties are the same as those mentioned above.
