the first place will rightly be assigned to man, for whose sake [great] nature appears to have created all other things - though she asks a cruel price for all her generous gifts, making it hardly possible to judge whether she has been more a kind parent to man or more a harsh stepmother. first of all, man alone of all animals she drapes with borrowed resources. on all the rest in various wise she bestows coverings - shells, bark, spines, hides, fur, bristles, hair, down, feathers, scales, fleeces; even the trunks of trees she has protected against cold and heat by bark, sometimes in two layers: but man alone on the day of his birth she casts away naked on the naked ground, to burst at once into wailing and weeping, and none other among all the animals is more prone to tears, and that immediately at the very beginning of life; whereas, i vow, the much-talked-of smile of infancy even at the earliest is bestowed on no child less than six weeks old. this initiation into the light is followed by a period of bondage such as befalls not even the animals bred in our midst, fettering all his limbs; and thus when successfully born he lies with hands and feet in shackles, weeping - the animal that is to lord it over all the rest, and he initiates his life with punishment because of one fault only, the offence of being born. alas the madness of those who think that from these beginnings they were bred to proud estate!
