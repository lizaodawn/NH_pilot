the lamprey spawns in any month, although all other fish have fixed breeding seasons. its eggs grow very quickly. lampreys are commonly believed to crawl out on to dry land and to be impregnated by copulating with snakes. aristotle gives the name of zmyrus to the male fish which generates, and says that the difference is that the lamprey is spotted and feeble whereas the zmyrus is self-coloured and hardy, and has teeth projecting outside the mouth. in northern gaul all lampreys have seven spots on the right jaw arranged like the constellation of the great bear, which are of a bright golden colour as long as the fish are alive, and are extinguished when they are deprived of life. vedius pollio, knight of rome, a member of the privy council under the late lamented augustus, found in this animal a means of displaying his cruelty when he threw slaves sentenced to death into ponds of lampreys - not that the wild animals on land were not sufficient for this purpose, but because with any other kind of creature he was not able to have the spectacle of a man being torn entirely to pieces at one moment. it is stated that tasting vinegar particularly drives them mad. their skin is very thin, whereas that of eels is rather thick, and verrius records that it used to be used for flogging boys who were sons of citizens, and that consequently it was not the practice for them to be punished with a fine.
