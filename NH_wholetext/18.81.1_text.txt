a thunderstorm in summer with more violent thunder than lightning foretells wind in that quarter, but one with less thunder than lightning is a sign of rain. if there are flickers of lightning and claps of thunder in a clear sky, there will be stormy weather, but this will be extremely severe when it lightens from all four quarters of the sky; lightning in the north-east only will portend rain for the next day, and lightning in the north a north wind. lightning on a fine night in the south, west or north-west will indicate wind and rain from the same quarters. thunder in the morning signifies wind, and thunder at midday rain.
