of conyza also two kinds are used in chaplets, male and female. they differ in their leaves. that of the female is thinner, more compressed and narrower; the male, which is more branched, has a pantile-shaped leaf. its blossom too is of a brighter colour; both blossom late, after arcturus. the scent of the male is heavier, of the female, sharper; for which reason the female is more suited to counteract the bites of beasts. the leaves of the female have the smell of honey; the root of the male is called by some libanotis, about which i have already spoken.
