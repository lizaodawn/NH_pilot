begin to prune an olive-yard a fortnight before the spring equinox; the six weeks from then onward will be the right time for pruning. prune it in this way: in a really fertile place, remove all the parts that are dry and any branches broken by the wind; in a place that is not fertile, trim away more and reduce well and disentangle out and make the stocks smooth. - in the autumn season turn up the earth round the olive-trees and add dung. - the man who stirs over his olive-yard most often and deepest, will plough up the thinnest roots. if be ploughs badly, the roots will spread out on the top of the ground and will become thicker, and the strength of the olive-trees will go away into them.
