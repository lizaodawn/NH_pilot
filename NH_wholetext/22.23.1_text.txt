alkanet too has a useful root, which is of the thickness of a finger. it is split into small divisions like the papyrus, and stains the hands the colour of blood; it prepares wool for costly colours. applied in wax ointment it heals ulcerous sores, especially those of the aged, and also burns. insoluble in water, it dissolves in oil, and this is the test of genuineness. a drachma of it is given to be taken in wine for pains in the kidneys, or if there be fever, in a decoction of behen nut; also for affections of the liver and spleen and for violent biliousness. it is applied in vinegar to leprous sores and freckles. the pounded leaves, with honey and meal, are applied to sprains, and doses of two drachmae in honey wine check looseness of the bowels. fleas are said to be killed by a decoction of the root in water.
