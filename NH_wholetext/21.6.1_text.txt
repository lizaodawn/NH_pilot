and on this matter extremely severe rules were enforced. in the second punic war fulvius, a banker, who was said to have looked out into the forum from his veranda wearing in the daytime a chaplet of roses, was on the authority of the senate led away to prison, not being released before the end of the war. p. munatius took a chaplet of flowers from a statue of marsyas and placed it on his own head. ordered by the triumyin to be put in chains for this offence he appealed to the tribunes of the people, who refused to intervene. very different was the custom at athens, where young revellers a in the forenoon would resort even to the schools of the philosophers. among us no other instance of this outrageous conduct has taken place except that of julia, daughter of the late augustus, who in her night frolics placed a chaplet on the statue of marsyas, as a letter of that god deplores.
