having begun by stating at considerable length the principles of climate and soil, we will now describe the trees that are produced by the care and skill of mankind. there are almost as many varieties of these as there are of those that grow wild, so bountifully have we repaid our debt of gratitude to nature; for they are produced either from seed or from root-cuttings or by layering or tearing off a slip or from a cutting or by grafting in an incision in the trunk of a tree. as for the story that at babylon they plant palm-leaves and produce a tree in that way, i am surprised that trogus believed it. some trees however can be grown by several of the above methods, and some by all of them.
