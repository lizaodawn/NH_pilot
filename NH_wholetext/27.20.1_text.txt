ascyron and ascyroides are like one another and also like hypericon, but what is called ascyroides has larger branches, which are like fennel-giant, red and with small yellow heads. the seed, in little cups, is very small, black, and resinous. the hairy tufts when crushed cause stains like blood, and therefore some have called the plant androsaemon. two-drachmae doses of the seed, taken in a sextarius of hydromel, are used for sciatica. it loosens the bowels, brings away bile, and is applied to burns.
