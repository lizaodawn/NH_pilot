with asses the teats are painful after foaling, and consequently they refuse to suckle their foals after five months, whereas mares give suck almost a whole year. whole-hooved species that never have more than two foals all have two dugs, and these always between the thighs. animals with cloven feet and horns have the dugs in the same place, cows having four and sheep and goats two. those that bear large litters and that have toes on the feet have more dugs, and these in a double row the whole length of the belly â€” for instance swine, of which the good breeds have twelve dugs and the common ones two less; similarly with dogs. some species have four dugs in the middle of the belly, for instance leopards, others two, for instance lionesses. the elephant has only two dugs beneath the shoulders and not on the breast but close to it, concealed under the shoulder-blades. none of the species with toes have dugs beneath the thighs. sows give their first dugs to the pigs born first in each litter, these being the dugs nearest to their throats, and each pig in the litter knows its own dug in the order in which it was born, and gets its food from that one and not at another. if its nurseling is taken away from it the dug at once goes dry and shrivels up, whereas if one out of the whole litter is left the dug that had been assigned to it at birth alone hangs down and does service. she-bears carry four dugs. dolphins only have two nipples at the bottom of the belly, which are not prominent and project slightly sideways; and the dolphin is the only animal that gives suck while in motion. but whales and seals also suckle their young.
