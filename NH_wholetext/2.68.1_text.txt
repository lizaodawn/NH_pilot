in the first place it is apparently reckoned as forming one half of the globe — just as if no part were cut off for the ocean itself, which surrounding and encircling the whole of it, and pouring forth and reabsorbing the waters and pasturing and all the moisture that goes to form the clouds, the stars themselves with all their numbers and their mighty size, can be supposed to occupy a space — of what extent, pray? the freehold owned by that mighty climatic mass is bound to be enormous — without limit! add that of what is left more than half is taken by the sky. for this has five divisions called zones, and all that lies beneath the two outermost zones that surround the poles at either end — both the pole named from the seven oxen and the one opposite to it called after auster — is all crushed under cruel frost and everlasting cold. in both regions perpetual mist prevails, and a light that the invisibility of the milder stars renders niggardly and that is only white with hoarfrost. but the middle portion of the lands, where the sun's orbit is, is scorched by its flames and burnt up by the proximity of its heat: this is the torrid zone. there are only two temperate zones between the torrid one and the frozen ones, and these have no communication with each other because of the fiery heat of the heavenly body.
