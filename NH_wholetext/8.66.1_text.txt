gestation in this genus lasts eleven months and the foal is born in the twelfth month. breeding takes place as a rule in the spring equinox when both animals are two-year-olds, but the progeny is stronger if breeding begins at three. a stallion goes on serving to the age of 33, as they are sent from the racecourse to the stud at 20. it is recorded that a stallion at opus even continued to 40, only he needed assistance in lifting his fore-quarters. but few animals are such unfertile sires as the horse; consequently intervals are allowed in breeding, and nevertheless a stallion cannot stand serving fifteen times in the same year. mares in heat are cooled down by having their manes shorn; they foal yearly up to 40. it is stated that a mare has lived to 75.
