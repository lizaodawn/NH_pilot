a different plant is erythrodanum, called by some ereuthodanum, and rubia by the romans, which is used to dye wool and to tan leather. as a medicine it is diuretic, and taken in hydromel cures jaundice (lichen too if applied with vinegar), sciatica and paralysis if the patient bathes daily while taking the draught. the root and the seed are emmenagogues, check diarrhoea and disperse gatherings. the branches with the leaves are applied for snakebites. the leaves also dye the hair. i find in some authorities that jaundice is cured if this shrub is merely looked at while worn as an amulet.
