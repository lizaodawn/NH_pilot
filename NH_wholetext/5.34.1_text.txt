the islands which lie in front of asia: of the islands which lie before asia the first is the one situate in the canopic mouth of the nile, and which received its name, it is said, from canopus, the pilot of menelaus. a second, called pharos, is joined by a bridge to alexandria, and was made a colony by the dictator caesar. in former times it was one day's sail from the mainland of egypt; at the present day it directs ships in their course by means of the fires which are lighted at night on the tower there; for in consequence of the insidious nature of the shoals, there are only three channels by which alexandria can be approached, those of steganus, posideum and taurus.
