it is impossible sufficiently to admire the pains and care of the old inquirers, who have explored everything and left nothing untried. in this very cytinus are little blossoms, unfolding of course before the pomegranate itself forms, which i have said a is called balaustium. so these blossoms too they investigated, and discovered them to neutralize the stings of scorpions. taken in drink they arrest excessive menstruation, and heal sores of the mouth, tonsils and uvula, spitting of blood, looseness of the bowels and stomach, disorders of the genitals, and running sores in any part of the body. they dried too these blossoms, to test their efficacy also when thus prepared, and found that reduced to powder they cure sufferers from dysentery even when on the point of death, checking the diarrhoea. moreover, they have taken the trouble to try out the very pips of the pomegranate berry. roasted and pounded they are good for the stomach, if taken in food or drink. they are taken by themselves in rain water to arrest looseness of the bowels. the root when boiled yields a juice which kills tapeworm, the dose being one victoriatus by weight. the same root, thoroughly boiled in water serves the same purposes as lycium.
