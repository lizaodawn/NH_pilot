consequently differences also occur in the fins, which are bestowed on fish instead of feet; none have more than four, some have three, some two, certain kinds none. in the lago di celano, but nowhere else, there is a fish that has eight fins to swim with. long slippery fish like eels and congers generally have two fins, others have none, for instance, the lamprey which also has no gills. all this class use the sea as snakes do the land, propelling themselves by twisting their bodies, and they also crawl on dry land; consequently this class are also longer-lived. some of the flat-fish too have not got fins, for example, the stingray - for these swim merely by means of their breadth - and the kinds called soft fish, such as polyps, since their feet serve them instead of fins.
