eretrian earth is named from the country that produces it. it was employed by nicomachus and parrhasius. it has cooling and emollient effects and fills lip wounds; if boiled it is prescribed as a desiccative, and is useful for pains in the head and for detecting internal suppurations, as these are shown to be present if when it is applied with water it immediately dries up.
