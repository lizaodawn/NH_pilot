the best honey wine is always made with old wine, it and honey combining very easily, which never happens when the wine is sweet. made out of dry wine it causes no flatulence in the stomach, nor does it do so when the honey is boiled, and the usual inconvenience with honey wine, a sense of fullness, is not experienced. it also revives a failing appetite. drunk cold it relaxes the bowels; taken warm it binds them in most cases, and puts on flesh. many have lived to a very great age on no other food but a mash made with honey wine, as in the well-known case of pollio itomilius. he was more than a century old when augustus, now in heaven, who was his host, asked him what was the chief means whereby he had kept such vigour of mind and body. his reply was: 'by honey wine within and by oil without.' varro relates that the rainbow disease (jaundice) has been styled the royal disease because it is treated with the royal drink of honey wine.
