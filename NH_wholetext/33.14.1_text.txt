but from the invention of money came the original source of avarice when usury was devised, and a profitable life of idleness; by rapid stages what was no longer mere avarice but a positive hunger for gold flared up with a sort of frenzy, inasmuch as the friend of gaius gracchus, septumuleius, a price having been set on gracchus's head to the amount of its weight in gold, when gracchus's head had been cut off, brought it to opimius, after adding to his unnatural murder by putting lead in the mouth of the corpse, and so cheated the state in addition. nor was it now some roman citizen, but king mithridates who disgraced the whole name of roman when he poured molten gold into the mouth of the general aquilius whom he had taken prisoner? these are the things that the lust for possessions engenders! one is ashamed to see the new-fangled names that are invented every now and then from the greek to denote silver vessels filigreed or inlaid with gold, niceties which make gilded plate fetch a higher price than gold plate, when we know that spartacus issued an order to his camp forbidding anybody to possess gold or silver: so much more spirit was there then in our runaway slaves! the orator messala has told us that the triumvir antony used vessels of gold in satisfying all the indecent necessities, an enormity that even cleopatra would have been so ashamed of. till then the record in extravagance had lain with foreigners â€” king philip sleeping with a gold goblet under his pillows and alexander the great's prefect hagnon of teos having his sandals soled with gold nails; but antony alone cheapened gold by this contumely of nature. how he deserved to be proscribed! but proscribed by spartacus!
