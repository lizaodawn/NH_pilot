the view is held that the extension of the use of silver to statues was made in the case of statues of his late lamented majesty augustus, owing to the sycophancy of the period, but this is erroneous. we find that previously a silver statue of pharnaces the first, king of pontus, was carried in the triumphal procession of pompey the great, as well as one of mithridates eupator, and also chariots of gold and silver were used. likewise silver has at some periods even supplanted gold, female luxury among the plebeians having its shoe buckles made of silver, as wearing gold buckles would be prohibited by the more common fashion. we have ourselves seen arellius fuscus (who was expelled from the equestrian order on a singularly grave charge) wearing silver rings when he sought to acquire celebrity for his school for youths. but what is the point of collecting these instances, when our soldiers' sword hilts are made of chased silver, even ivory not being thought good enough; and when their scabbards jingle with little silver chains and their belts with silver tabs, nay nowadays our schools for pages lust at the point of adolescence wear silver badges as a safeguard, and women use silver to wash in and scorn sitting-baths not made of silver, and the same substance does service both for our viands and for our baser needs? if only fabricius could see these displays of luxury — women's bathrooms with floors of silver, leaving nowhere to set your feet — and the women bathing in company with men — if only fabricius, who forbade gallant generals to possess more than a dish and a saltcellar of silver, could see how nowadays the rewards of valour are made from the utensils of luxury, or else are broken up to make them! alas for our present manners — fabricius makes us blush!
