this also explains the contrary principle of their motions. for the higher planets travel most quickly in their evening setting, whereas these travel most slowly, and the former are farthest from the earth when their pace is slowest but the latter are highest when their pace is quickest — the reason being that with the latter the circumference of the circle accelerates their pace in the same manner as proximity to the centre does in the case of the former; the former begin to decelerate from their morning setting, but the latter to accelerate. the former travel backward from their morning to their evening station, the planet venus from her evening to her morning station. but she begins to climb her latitude after her morning rise, but after her morning station to ascend her altitude and follow the sun, being swiftest and highest at her morning setting; whereas she begins to descend in latitude and decelerate after her evening rising, and to turn back and simultaneously to descend in altitude after her evening station; on the other hand the planet mercury begins to climb in both ways after his morning rising, but after his evening rising to descend in latitude, and following the sun at an interval of 15 degrees he stands motionless for almost four days. afterwards he descends from his altitude and proceeds back from his evening setting to his morning rise. and only this planet and the moon set in as many days as they have risen in; venus ascends in 15 times as many days as she sets in, while saturn and jupiter descend in twice as many, and mars in actually four times as many. so great is the variety of nature; but the reason is evident — bodies that strain up into the heat of the sun also have difficulty in descending.
