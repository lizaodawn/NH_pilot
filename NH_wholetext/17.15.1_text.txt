elm-seed should be collected about the first of march, before the tree is clothed with foliage, when the seed is beginning to turn yellow. then it should be left in the shade to dry for two days, and afterwards thickly sown in ground that has been broken up, and a layer of earth sifted fine in a sieve should be sprinkled on it, of the thickness recommended in the case of cypresses; and if no rain comes to your assistance, it must be watered. a year afterwards the plants should be removed from the rows of the beds to the elm-grounds and planted at a distance of a foot apart each way. atinian elms it pays better to plant in autumn, because they are grown from cuttings, having no seed. for a grove in the neighbourhood of the city they should be transplanted when they are five years old, or, as some hold, when they have reached a height of twenty feet. they should be set in what is called a 'nine-square-foot' trench, 3 ft. deep and 3 ft. broad and even larger. when they have been planted, mounds 3 ft. high from the ground level should be heaped round them — the name for these mounds in campania is 'little altars'. the spacing must be settled according to the nature of the place: in level country it is suitable to plant the young trees wider apart. it is also proper to plant out poplars and ashes earlier, because they bud more quickly — that is, planting should start on the 13th of february: these frees also growing from cuttings. in spacing out trees and plantations and planning vineyards the diagonal arrangement of rows is commonly adopted and is essential, being not only advantageous in allowing the passage of air, but also agreeable in appearance, as in whatever direction you look at the plantation a row of trees stretches out in a straight line. in the case of poplars the same method of growing them from seed is used as with elms, and also the same method of transplanting them from nurseries or forests.
