headed leek has the same properties as cutleek, but they are stronger. those who spit blood are given its juice along with ground gall-nut or frankincense, or with gum arabic. hippocrates directs it also to be given without other ingredient, and is of opinion that a contracted womb opens under its influence; likewise that by its use as food the fertility of women is increased. beaten up, with honey added, it cleanses sores. cough, catarrh of the chest, and affections of the lungs and of the trachea are cured by it when given in a draught of barley-water or eaten raw, the head excepted, without bread; it must however be taken only on alternate days, even if pus be expectorated. given thus it greatly benefits the voice, venery and sleep. the heads, boiled in water that is twice changed checks diarrhoea and chronic fluxes; a decoction of the skin serves as a dye for grey hair.
