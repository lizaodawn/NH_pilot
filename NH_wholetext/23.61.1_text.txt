there is also a wild pomegranate, so called because of its likeness to the cultivated tree. its roots, which have a red skin, act as a soporific if taken in wine, a denarius by weight being the dose. its seed taken in drink dries up water under the skin. if pomegranate rind be burned the smoke keeps off gnats.
