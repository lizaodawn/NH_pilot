germany: the whole of the shores of this sea as far as the scaldis, a river of germany, is inhabited by nations, the dimensions of whose respective territories it is quite impossible to state, so immensely do the authors differ who have touched upon this subject. the greek writers and some of our own countrymen have stated the coast of germany to be 2500 miles in extent, while agrippa, comprising rhaetia and noricum in his estimate, makes the length to be 686 miles, and the breadth 148. the breadth of rhaetia alone however very nearly exceeds that number of miles, and indeed we ought to state that it was only subjugated at about the period of the death of that general; while as for germany, the whole of it was not thoroughly known to us for many years after his time. if i may be allowed to form a conjecture, the margin of the coast will be found to be not far short of the estimate of the greek writers, while the distance in a straight line will nearly correspond with that mentioned by agrippa.
