the thistle has both leaf and stem covered by a prickly down, and so have acorna, leucacanthos, chalceos, cnecos, polyacanthos, onopyxos, helxine, scolymos. the chamaeleon has no prickles on its leaves. there is however this difference also, that some of these plants have many stems and branches, the thistle for instance, while the cnecos has one stem and no branches. some are prickly only at the head, the erynge for instance; some, like tetralix and helxine, blossom in summer. scolymos too blossoms late and long. the acorna is distinguished (from cnecos) only by its reddish colour and richer juice. atractylis too would be just the same, were it not whiter and did it not shed a blood-like juice that has caused some to call it phonos; it also has a bad smell, and its seed ripens late - in fact not before autumn, though this can be said of all prickly plants. all of these however can be reproduced either from seed or from the root. scolymus, one of the thistle group, differs from these in that its root is edible when boiled. it is a strange thing that in this group, without intermission throughout the whole summer, part blossoms, part buds, and part produces seed. as the leaves dry the prickles cease to sting. helxine is not often seen, and not in all countries; it shoots out leaves from its root, out of the middle of which swells up as it were an apple, covered with foliage of its own. the top of its head contains a gum of pleasant flavour, called thorn mastich.
