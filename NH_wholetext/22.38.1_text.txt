scandix (chervil) too is classed by the greeks as a wild vegetable, as ophion and erasistratus report. a decoction of it too tones up loose bowels, its seed in vinegar immediately checks hiccough. it is applied to burns and is diuretic. the juice of the decoction is good for stomach, liver, kidneys, and bladder. this is the plant that aristophanes uses to poke fun at the poet euripides, implying that his mother had not been a seller of even proper vegetables, but only of scandix. it would be the same sort of plant as enthryscum, were its leaves thinner and more fragrant. its special merit is that it gives strength to a body exhausted by sexual indulgence, and revives sexual virility when flagging through old age. it checks leucorrhoea in women.
