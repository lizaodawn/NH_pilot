the bite of the shrewmouse is healed by lamb's rennet taken in wine, by the ash of a ram's hoof with honey, and by a young weasel, as i have prescribed for snakebite. if it has bitten draught-animals, a freshly killed mouse is applied with salt, or a bat's gall in vinegar. the shrew-mouse itself, torn asunder and applied, is a remedy for its own bite; but if a pregnant shrewmouse has bitten, it bursts open at once. it is best if the mouse applied is the one which gave the bite, but they preserve them for this purpose in oil, or enclosed in clay. another remedy for its bite is earth from a wheel rut. for they say that it will not cross a wheel rut owing to a sort of natural torpor.
