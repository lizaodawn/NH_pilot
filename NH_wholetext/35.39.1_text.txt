it is not agreed who was the inventor of painting in wax and of designs in encaustic. some people think it was a discovery of aristides, subsequently brought to perfection by praxiteles, but there were encaustic paintings in existence at a considerably earlier date, for instance those of polygnotus, and nicanor and mnasilaus of paros. also elasippus of aigina has inscribed on a picture enekaen ('burnt in'), which he would not have done if the art of encaustic painting-had not been invented.
