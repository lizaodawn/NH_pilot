while we know that ladies' bedsteads have for a long time now been entirely covered with silver plating, and so for long have banqueting-couches also. it is recorded that carvilius pollio, knight of rome, was the first person who had silver put on these latter, though not so as to plate them all over or make them to the delos pattern, but in the carthaginian style. in this latter style he also had bedsteads made of gold, and not long afterwards silver bedsteads were made, in imitation of those of delos. all this extravagance however was expiated by the civil war of sulla.
