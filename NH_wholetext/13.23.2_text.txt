paper of all kinds is 'woven' on a board moistened with water from the nile, muddy liquid supplying the effect of glue. first an upright layer is smeared on to the table, using the full length of papyrus available after the trimmings have been cut off at both ends, and afterwards cross strips complete the lattice-work. the next step is to press it in presses, and the sheets are dried in the sun and then joined together, the next strip used always diminishing in quality down to the worst of all. there are never more than twenty sheets to a roll.
