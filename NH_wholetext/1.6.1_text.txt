as for your sire, your brother and yourself, we have dealt with you all in a regular book, the history of our own times, that begins where aufidius's history leaves off. where is this work? you will enquire. the draft has long been finished and in safe keeping; and in any case it was my resolve to entrust it to my heir, to prevent its being thought that my lifetime bestowed anything on ambition: accordingly i do a good turn to those who seize the vacant position, and indeed also to future generations, who i know will challenge us to battle as we ourselves have challenged our predecessors. you will deem it a proof of this pride of mine that i have prefaced these volumes with the names of my authorities. i have done so because it is, in my opinion, a pleasant thing and one that shows an honourable modesty, to own up to those who were the means of one's achievements, not to do as most of the authors to whom i have referred did. for you must know that when collating authorities i have found that the most professedly reliable and modern writers have copied the old authors word for word, without acknowledgement, not in that valorous spirit of virgil, for the purpose of rivalry, nor with the candour of cicero who in his republic declares himself a companion of plato, and in his consolation to his daughter says 'i follow crantor,' and similarly as to panaetius in his de officiis — volumes that you know to be worth having in one's hands every day, nay even learning by heart. surely it marks a mean spirit and an unfortunate disposition to prefer being detected in a theft to repaying a loan — especially as interest creates capital.
