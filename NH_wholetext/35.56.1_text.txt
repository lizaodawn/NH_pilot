white earth of chios is also among medicaments; its effect is the same as that of samos earth. it is specially used as a cosmetic for the skin of women, and selinunte earth is used in the same way. the latter is of the colour of milk, and it dissolves very quickly in water, and likewise dissolved in milk it is used for touching up the whitewash on plastered walls. pnigitis, or suffocating earth closely resembles that of eretria, only it is in larger lumps and is sticky. it produces the same effect as cimolian earth, although it is less powerful. arnpelitis or vine earth is very like bitumen. the test for it is whether it dissolves when oil is put in it, like wax, and whether when roasted it retains a blackish colour. it is used for an emollient and dissipant, and is added to drugs for these purposes, especially in the case of eyelash beautifiers and for hair dyes.
