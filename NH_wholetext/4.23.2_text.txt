after we pass these, no regular order can be well observed; the rest must therefore be mentioned indiscriminately. there is the island of scyros, and that of ios, eighteen miles distant from naxos, and deserving of all veneration for the tomb there of homer; it is twenty-five miles in length, and was formerly known by the name of phoenice; also odia, oletandros, and gyara, with a city of the same name, the island being twelve miles in circumference, and distant from andros sixty-two. at a distance of eighty miles from gyara is syrnos, then cynaethus, telos, noted for its unguents, and by callimachus called agathussa, donusa, patmos, thirty miles in circumference, the corassiae, lebinthus, leros, cinara; sicinus, formerly called oinoe; hieracia, also called onus; casos, likewise called astrabe; cimolus, or echinussa; and melos, with a city of that name, which island aristides calls memblis, aristotle zephyria, callimachus mimallis, and heraclides called siphis and acyta. this last is the most circular in form of all these islands. [buporthmus], machia, then hypere, formerly patage, or, as others have it, platage, but now called amorgos, polyaegos, sapyle, and thera, known as calliste when it first sprang from the waves. from this, at a later period, the island of therasia was torn away, and between the two afterwards arose automate, also called hiera, and thia, which in our own times came into existence in the vicinity of these islands. ios is distant from thera twenty-five miles.
