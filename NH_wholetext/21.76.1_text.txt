there are both wild and cultivated violets. the mauve ones are cooling and are applied to the stomach for inflammations, to the forehead also when the head bums, to the eyes especially for fluxes, for prolapsus of the anus and of the womb, and to abscesses. placed on the head in chaplets, or even smelt, they disperse the after-effects of drinking and its headaches, as well as quinsies when taken in water. the mauve variety, taken in water, is a cure for epilepsy, especially in children. the seed of the violet neutralizes the stings of scorpions. on the other hand the flower of the white violet opens abscesses, and even disperses them. both the white violet, however, and the yellow reduce the menstrual discharge and are diuretic. freshly gathered they have less potency, for which reason they should be dried and not used until they are at least a year old. half a cyathus of the yellow violet taken in three of water promotes menstruation. its roots used with vinegar as a liniment soothe the spleen, and likewise gout, but for inflammations of the eyes myrrh and saffron should be added to them. the leaves with honey cleanse sores on the head. with wax ointment they heal cracks in the anus and such as are in moist parts of the body. used with vinegar, however, they heal abscesses.
