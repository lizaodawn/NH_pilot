but occasionally pythagoras draws on the theory of music, and designates the distance between the earth and the moon as a whole tone, that between the moon and mercury a semitone, between mercury and venus the same, between her and the sun a tone and a half, between the sun and mars a tone (the same as the distance between the earth and the moon), between mars and jupiter half a tone, between jupiter and saturn half a tone, between saturn and the zodiac a tone and a half: the seven tones thus producing the so-called diapason, a universal harmony; in this saturn moves in the dorian mode, jupiter in the phrygian, and similarly with the other planets - a refinement more entertaining than convincing.
