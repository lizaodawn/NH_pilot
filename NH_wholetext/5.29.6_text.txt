caria is especially distinguished for the fame of its places in the interior; for here are mylasa, a free town, and that of antiochia, on the site of the former towns of symmaethos and cranaos: it is now surrounded by the rivers maeander and morsynos [orsinus]. in this district also was formerly maeandropolis; we find also eumenia, situate on the river cludros, the river glaucus, the town of lysias and orthosa, the district of berecynthus, nysa, and tralles, also called euanthia, seleucia, and antiochia: it is washed by the river eudon, while the thebais runs through it. some authors say that a nation of pygmies formerly dwelt here. besides the preceding towns, there are thydonos, pyrrha, eurome, heraclea, amyzon, the free town of alabanda, which has given name to that jurisdiction, the free town of stratonicea, hynidos, ceramus, troezene, and phorontis. at a greater distance, but resorting to the same place of jurisdiction, are the orthronienses, the alindienses or hippini, the xystiani, the hydissenses, the apolloniatae, the trapezopolitae, and the aphrodisienses, a free people. besides the above, there are the towns of coscinus, and harpasa, situate on the river harpasus, which also passed the town of trallicon when it was in existence.
