now let somebody raise the questions whether hercules was one person and how many father libers there were, and all the other puzzles buried beneath the litter of antiquity! here on a trifling matter connected with our own country-houses, a thing constantly in evidence, there is no agreement among the authorities â€” the question whether the king bee alone has no sting and is armed only with the grandeur of his office, or whether nature has indeed bestowed one upon him but has merely denied him the use of it. it is a well established fact that the ruler does not use a sting. the commons surround him with a marvellous obedience. when he goes in procession, the whole swarm accompanies him and is massed around him to encircle and protect him, not allowing him to be seen. during the rest of the time, while the people are engaged in labour, he himself goes the circuit of the works inside, with the appearance of urging them on, while he alone is free from duty. he is surrounded by certain retainers and lictors as the constant guardians of his authority. he only issues abroad when the swarm is about to migrate; intelligence of this is given long before, as a buzzing noise has been going on for some days in the hive, a sign of their preparation while they are selecting a suitable day. if anybody should cut off one of his wings, the swarm would not run away. when they have started, each one wants to be next him and delights to be seen on duty; when he is tired they support him with their shoulders, and carry him entirely if he is more completely exhausted. any bee that falls out from weariness or happens to stray from the main body, follows on by scent. wherever the king alights is the camping place of the whole body.
