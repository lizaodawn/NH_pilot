the eggs are in some cases white, as with the dove and partridge, in others pale-coloured, as with waterfowl, in others spotted, as those of the guinea-hen, in others of a red colour, as in the case of the pheasant and the lesser kestrel. the inside of every bird's egg is of two colours; in that of the aquatic birds there is more yellow than white, and that yellow is brighter than with the other species. fishes' eggs are of one colour, which contains no bright white. birds' eggs are made easily breakable by heat, snakes' eggs are made flexible by cold, and fishes' eggs are softened by liquid. aquatic species have round eggs, but almost all others oval-shaped ones. they are laid with their roundest part in front, the shell of whatever portions they emerge with being soft but becoming hard immediately after the process. long-shaped eggs are thought by horace to have a more agreeable flavour. eggs of a rounder formation produce a hen chicken and the rest a cock. the navel in eggs is at the top end, projecting like a speck in the shell.
