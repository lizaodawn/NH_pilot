i am not surprised that the colour had an important rank, for as far back as trojan times red ochre was highly valued, as evidenced by homer, who speaks of it as a distinguished colour for ships, although otherwise he rarely alludes to colours and paintings. the greek name for it is 'miltos,' and they call minium 'cinnabar.' this gave rise to a mistake owing to the name 'indian cinnabar,' for that is the name the greeks give to the gore of a snake crushed by the weight of dying elephants, when the blood of each animal gets mixed together, as we have said; and there is no other colour that properly represents blood in a picture. that kind of cinnabar is extremely useful for antidotes and medicaments. but our doctors, i swear, because they give the name of cinnabar to minium also, employ this minium, which as we shall soon show is a poison.
