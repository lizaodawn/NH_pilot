in the species with solid feet the legs are of the proper size at birth, afterwards more truly stretching out than growing. consequently in infancy they scratch their ears with their hind feet, which when older they are unable to do, because length of time increases the size of only the surface of their bodies. for this reason at the early stages they can only feed by bending their knees, and this goes on till their neck reaches full growth. there is a dwarf kind in all species of animals, and even among birds.
