alectoros lophos, which we romans call, 'comb' (crista), has several leaves like a cock's comb, a slender stem, and black seed in pods. boiled with ground beans it is useful for cough, and with the addition of honey for film on the eyes. the seed is cast whole into the eye; it does no harm but attracts the film to itself. changing colour it begins to turn from black to white, swells, and works out by itself.
