in the bloodless class, the langouste is protected by a fragile rind. langoustes stay in retirement for five months in each year; and likewise crabs, which go into hiding at the same season; and both species discard their old age at the beginning of spring in the same way as snakes do, by renewing their skins. all other aquatic species swim, but langoustes float about in the manner of reptiles; if no danger threatens they go forward in a straight course with their horns, which are buttoned by their own rounded ends, stretched out at their sides, but at a moment of alarm they advance slanting sideways with their horns held erect. they use their horns in fighting one another. the langouste is the only animal whose flesh is of a yielding texture with no hardness, unless it is boiled alive its hot water. langoustes live in rocky places, whereas crabs live on soft mud. in winter they haunt sunny shores, but in summer they retire into the dim depths of the sea. all creatures of this class suffer in winter, but get fat in autumn and spring, and more so at full moon, because the moon mellows them with its warm glow by night.
