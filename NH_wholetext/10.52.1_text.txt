next to partridges the habits of pigeons are most noticeable for a similar reason. these possess the greatest modesty, and adultery is unknown to either sex; they do not violate the faith of wedlock, and they keep house in company - unless unmated or widowed a pigeon does not leave its nest. also they say that the cock pigeon is domineering, and occasionally even unkind, as he is suspicious of adultery although not himself prone to it; in this state his throat is full of complaining and his beak deals savage pecks, and upon his satisfaction there follows billing and fawning with repeated twirlings of his feet during his entreaties for indulgence. both partners have equal affection for their offspring; this also often gives occasion for chastisement, when the hen is too slack in coming home to the chicks. when she is producing a brood she receives comfort and attendance from the cock. for the chicks at first they collect saltish earth in their throat and disgorge it into their beaks, to get them into proper condition for food. it is a peculiarity of this species and of the turtledove not to raise the neck backward when drinking, and to take copious draughts like cattle.
