in old days the sturgeon was held to be the noblest of the fishes, being the only one with its scales turned towards the mouth, in the opposite direction to the one in which it swims; but now it is held in no esteem, which for my part i think surprising, as it is a fish seldom to be found. one name for it is the elops.
