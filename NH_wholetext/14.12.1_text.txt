the liquors made from grape-skins soaked in water, called by the greeks seconds and by cato and ourselves after-wine, cannot rightly be styled wines, but nevertheless are counted among the wines of the working classes. they are of three kinds: one is made by adding to the skins water to the amount of a tenth of the quantity of must that has been pressed out, and so leaving the skins to soak for twenty-four hours and then again putting them under the press; another, by a method of manufacture that has been commonly employed by the greeks, i.e. by adding water to the amount of a third of the juice that has been pressed out, and after submitting the pulp to pressure, boiling it down to one-third of its original quantity; while the third kind is pressed out of the wine-lees â€” cato's name for this is 'lees-wine.' none of these liquors is drinkable if kept more than a year.
