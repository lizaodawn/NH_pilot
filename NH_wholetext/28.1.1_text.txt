i should have finished describing the character of all things growing between heaven and earth, leaving only whatever is dug out of the ground itself, if dealing with remedies derived from plants and shrubs did not make me digress to the wider sphere of medicines obtained from the very living creatures that themselves are healed. well then, shall i, who have described plants and forms of flowers, including many rare things that are difficult to find, say nothing about the benefits to man that are to be found in man himself, nothing about the other kinds of remedies that live among us, especially as life itself becomes a punishment for those who are not free from pains and diseases? surely i must, and i shall devote all my care to the task, although i realize the risk of causing disgust, since it is my fixed determination to have less regard for popularity than for benefiting human life. furthermore, my investigations will include foreign things and even outlandish customs; belief here can appeal only to authority, although i myself also, when choosing my detail, have striven to find views almost universally believed, and i have stressed careful research rather than abundance of material. one thing it is very necessary to point out: i have already described the natures of living creatures and the discoveries we owe to each (for they did no less good by discovering medicines than they do by supplying them). i am now showing what help is to be found in the creatures themselves. i did not entirely leave out this then; so although the new matter is different, it is yet intimately connected with the old.
