in old days the statues dedicated were simply clad in the toga. also naked figures holding spears, made from models of greek young men from the gymnasiums - what are called figures of achilles - became popular. the greek practice is to leave the figure entirely nude, whereas roman and military statuary adds a breastplate: indeed the dictator caesar gave permission for a statue wearing a cuirass to be erected in his honour in his forum. as for the statues in the garb of the luperci, they are modern innovations, lust as much as the portrait-statues dressed in cloaks that have recently appeared. mancinus set up a statue of himself in the dress that he had worn when surrendered to the enemy. it has been remarked by writers that the poet lucius accius also set up a very tall statue of himself in the shrine of the latin muses, although he was a very short man. assuredly equestrian statues are popular at rome, the fashion for them having no doubt been derived from greece; but the greeks used only to erect statues of winners of races on horseback at their sacred contests, although subsequently they also erected statues of winners with two-horse or four-horse chariots; and this is the origin of our chariot-groups in honour of those who have celebrated a triumphal procession. but this belongs to a late date, and among those monuments it was not till the time of his late lamented majesty augustus that chariots with six horses occurred, and likewise elephants.
