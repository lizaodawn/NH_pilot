there are two sorts of thyme, the pale and the darkish. thyme blossoms about the solstices when too the bees sip from it, and a forecast can be made about the honey harvest. for the beekeepers hope for a bumper one if there be an abundance of blossom. showers damage it and make the blossom fall off. the seed of thyme is imperceptible to sight, and yet that of wild marjoram, although very tiny, does not escape our eye. but what does it matter that nature has hidden it? reason tells us that the seed is in the flower itself, and if that be sown a plant grows from it. what have men left untried? attic honey is thought more highly of than any in the whole world. thyme therefore has been imported from attica, and grown with difficulty, we are told, from the blossom. but a further hindrance arose through another peculiar characteristic of attic thyme, which will not survive in the absence of sea breezes. the same view indeed was held of old about all kinds of thyme, and people believed that it was for this reason that it did not grow in arcadia, while the olive too, they thought, is only found within three hundred stades from the sea. yet thyme we know today covers even the stony plains of the province of gallia narbonensis, being almost the only source of revenue, thousands of sheep being brought there from distant regions to browse upon the thyme.
