in our own period there have been few instances of consummate skill in this field, but it is all the more proper on that account not to omit them, so as also to make known the rewards of success, which in every department attract the greatest attention. well, the greatest distinction was achieved by acilius sthenelus, a plebeian, the son of a freedman, by his intensive cultivation of a vineyard of not more than 60 iugera, in the region of mentana, which he sold for 400,000 sesterces. also vetulenus aegialus, he too a freedman, gained a great reputation in the district of liternum in campania, and a still greater reputation in public esteem on account of his cultivating the estate which had been the place of exile of africanus; but the greatest reputation, thanks to the activity of the same sthenelus, attached to remmius palaemon, also famous for his treatise on grammar, who within the last 20 years bought a farm for 600,000 sesterces in the same region of mentana, at the turning off the main road ten miles from rome. the low price of property through all the districts just outside the city in every direction is notorious, but especially in the neighbourhood referred to, since palaemon had bought farms that had also been let down by neglect and that were not above the average quality of soil even among those extremely poor estates. he undertook the cultivation of this property not from any high motive but at first out of vanity, for which he was known to be so remarkable; but he had the vineyards dug and trenched afresh under the superintendence of sthenelus, and so, though only playing the part of a farmer, he finally got the estate into an almost incredibly wonderful condition, as within eight years, the vintage, while still hanging on the trees, was knocked down to a purchaser at a price of 400,000 sesterces; and everybody ran to see the piles of grapes in these vineyards, while the sluggish neighbourhood vindicated itself against this discredit by the excuse of his exceptionally profound studies, and recently annaeus seneca, the most learned person of the day, and eminent in power which ultimately grew to excess and came crashing about his ears - a man who was at all events no admirer of frivolities - was seized with such a passionate desire for this estate that he was not ashamed to concede this victory to one whom he otherwise hated and who was sure to make the most of this advertisement, by buying the vineyards in question at four times the price palaemon had paid for it within hardly more than ten years of its being under his management. this was a method of cultivation which it would be profitable to apply to the farms of caecubum and setia, since even subsequently the estate has frequently produced seven sacks, that is 140 jars, of must to the iugerum. and to prevent anyone from supposing that the records of the days of old were beaten on this occasion, cato also wrote that there were returns of 10 sacks to the iugerum, these instances conclusively proving that the merchant does not obtain more profit by rashly trespassing on the seas nor by going as far as the coast of the red sea or of the indian ocean to seek for merchandise, than is yielded by a diligently cultivated homestead.
