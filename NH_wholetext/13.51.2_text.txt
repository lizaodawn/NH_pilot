juba relates that in the neighbourhood of the cave-dwellers' islands a bush grows at the bottom of the sea called 'hair of isis,' which has no leaves and resembles coral, and that when it is lopped it changes its colour to black and turns hard, and when it falls it breaks; and so does another marine bush the greek name for which means 'the graces' eyelid,' which is a potent love-charm; he says women make bracelets and necklaces of it. he declares that when being taken the bush is aware of it and turns as hard as horn, blunting the edge of the knife, but that if it is cut before it is aware of the danger that threatens it, it turns into stone.
