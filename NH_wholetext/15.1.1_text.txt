one of the most celebrated greek authors, theophrastus, who flourished about 314 b.c., stated that the olive only grows at places within forty miles of the sea, while fenestella says that in 581 bc., during the reign of tarquinius priscus, it was not found at all in italy and spain or in africa; whereas at the present day it has penetrated even across the alps and into the middle of the gallic and spanish provinces. indeed in 249 bc., the year in which appius claudius the grandson of appius claudius caecus and lucius junius were the consuls, olive-oil cost 10 asses for 12 lbs. and somewhat later, in 74 bc., the curule aedile marcus scius, son of lucius, throughout the whole of his year of office supplied the roman public with oil at the rate of an as for 10 lbs. these facts will seem less surprising to a person who knows that 22 years later in the third consulship of gnaeus pompeius italy exported oil to the provinces. also hesiod, who thought that instruction in agriculture was a prime necessity of life, declared that no one had ever gathered fruit from an olive-tree of his own planting â€” so slow a business it was in those days, whereas now olive-trees bear even in the nursery-gardens, and after they have been transplanted olives are picked from them the next year.
