the same author has given an account of a remedy against ants, which are not the least destructive of pests in gardens not well supplied with water; the plan is to stop up the mouths of ant-holes with sea-slime or ashes. but the most effective thing for killing ants is the heliotrope plant; and some people also think that water in which an unbaked brick has been soaked is injurious to these insects. a protection for rapes is to sow some fitch with them, and similarly chick-pea for cabbages, as it keeps off caterpillars. if neglect of this precaution has led to the appearance of caterpillars, the remedy is to sprinkle them with a decoction of wormwood or of houseleek; we have mentioned this class of plant, which some call immortel. it is stated that if cabbage seed is soaked in the juice of houseleek before being sown, the cabbages will be immune from all kinds of insects; and it is said that caterpillars can be totally exterminated in gardens by fixing up on a stake the skull of an animal of the horse class, provided it is that of a female. there is also a story that a river crab hung up in the middle of a garden is a protection against caterpillars. some people touch plants which they want to be immune from caterpillars with slips of blood-red cornel. also gnats infest damp gardens, especially if there are any shrubs in them; these can be driven away by burning galbanum resin.
