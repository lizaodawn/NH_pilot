it is against nature to be born feet foremost; this is the reason why the designation of 'agrippa' has been applied to persons so born — meaning 'born with difficulty' [aegre partus]; marcus agrippa is said to have been born in this manner, almost the solitary instance of a successful career among all those so born — although he too is deemed to have paid the penalty which his irregular birth foretold, by a youth made unhappy by lameness, a lifetime passed amidst warfare and ever exposed to the approach of death, by the misfortune caused to the world by his whole progeny but especially due to his two daughters a who became the mothers of the emperors gaius caligula and domitius nero, the two firebrands of mankind; and also by the shortness of his life, as he was cut off at the age of fifty during the agony caused him by his wife's adulteries and during his irksome subjection to his father-in-law augustus. nero also, who was emperor shortly before and whose entire rule showed him the enemy of mankind, is stated in his mother agrippina's memoirs to have been born feet first. it is nature's method for a human being to be born head first, and it is the custom for him to be carried to burial feet first.
