phthiotis: haemonia follows, a country which has often changed its name, having been successively called pelasgic argos, hellas, thessaly, and dryopis, always taking its surname from its kings. in this country was born the king whose name was graecus; and from whom graecia was so called; and here too was born hellen, from whom the hellenes derive their name. the same people homer has called by three different names, myrmidones, hellenes, and achaei.
