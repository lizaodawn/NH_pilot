scale of iron, obtained from a sharp edge or point, is also employed, and has an effect extremely like that of rust only more active, for which reason it is employed even for running at the eyes. it arrests haemorrhage, though it is with iron that wounds are chiefly made! and it also arrests female discharges. it is also applied against troubles of the spleen, and it cheeks haemorrhoidal swellings and creeping ulcers. applied for a brief period in the form of a powder it is good for the eyelids. but its chief recommendation is its use in a wet plaster for cleaning wounds and fistulas and for eating out every kind of callosity and making new flesh on bones that have been denuded. the following are the ingredients: six obols of bee-glue, six drams of cimolo earth, two drams of pounded copper, two of scale of iron, ten of wax and a pint of oil. when it is desired to cleanse or fill up wounds, wax plaster is added to these ingredients.
