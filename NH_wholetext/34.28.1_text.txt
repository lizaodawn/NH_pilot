there is also another kind of verdigris called from the greek worm-like verdigris, made by grinding up in a mortar of true cyprian copper with a pestle of the same metal equal weights of alum and salt or soda with the very strongest white vinegar. this preparation is only made on the very hottest days of the year, about the rising of the dog-star. the mixture is ground up until it becomes of a green colour and shrivels into what looks like a cluster of small worms, whence its name. to remedy any that is blemished, the urine of a young boy to twice the quantity of vinegar that was used is added to the mixture. used as a drug, worm-verdigris has the same effect as santerna which we spoke of as used for soldering gold; both of them have the same properties as verdigris. native worm-verdigris is also obtained by scraping a copper ore of which we shall now speak.
