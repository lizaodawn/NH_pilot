since i have frequently to use greek names when giving weights and measures, i will add at this place their equivalents, once and for all. the attic drachma, for it is generally the attic standard that physicians adopt, has the weight of a silver denarius, and the same makes six oboli, the obolus being ten chalci. the cyathus as a measure weighs ten drachmae; when the measure of an acetabulum is spoken of, it means the quarter of a hemina, that is fifteen drachmae. the mna, that our countrymen call the mina, weighs one hundred attic drachmae.
