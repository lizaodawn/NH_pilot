leuce, a plant like mercurialis, has a reason for the name it bears, because a white line runs down the middle of the leaves, which is why some call it mesoleucion. its juice heals fistulas; crushed, the plant itself cures malignant ulcers. perhaps it is the same as the plant called leueas, which is a remedy for the poison of all sea creatures. my authorities do not report its appearance; they only say that the wild plant has the broader leaves, that this is the more efficacious, and has the more pungent seed.
