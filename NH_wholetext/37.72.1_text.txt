precious stones are named after animals; for example 'carcinias' takes its name from the colour of the crab, and 'echitis' from that of the viper. 'scorpitis' is so named because it displays the colour or else the likeness of a scorpion, 'scaritis,' similarly, of a parrot-wrasse, and 'triglitis,' of a red mullet. 'aegophthalmos' takes its name from a goat's eye, and another stone likewise from a pig's eye. 'geranitis' owes its name to the crane's neck, 'hieracitis' to the kite and 'aetitis' to the colour of the white-tailed eagle. 'myrmecitis' displays a naturally formed likeness of a crawling ant, and 'cantharias' that of scarab beetles. 'lycophthalmos' is a stone of four colours, red mixed with blood-red, while in the middle it has black encircled by white, like a wolf's eye. 'taos' is like a peacock; and a stone which i find bearing the name 'timictonia' similarly resembles an asp in colour.
