from the natives, however, we learn, that on the coast, at a distance of 150 miles from the salat, the river asanapresents itself; its waters are salt, but it is remarkable for its fine harbour. they also say that after this we come to a river known by the name of fut, and then, after crossing another called vior which lies on the road, at a distance of 200 miles we arrive at dyris, such being the name which in their language they give to mount atlas. according to their story there are still existing in its vicinity many vestiges which tend to prove that the locality was once inhabited; such as the remains of vineyards and plantations of palm-trees.
