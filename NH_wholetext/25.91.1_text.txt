it is supposed that the sight is improved by the greater centaury if the eyes are fomented by an infusion of it in water; while by the juice of the lesser centaury with the addition of honey gnats are removed, cloudiness and films are dispersed, and scars smoothed out; also that albugo even of draught animals is made better by sideritis. but chelidonia is a wonderful cure for all the above-mentioned eye troubles. the root of panaces with pearl barley is applied to the eyes for fluxes. for checking such fluxes the seed of henbane is taken in wine in doses of an obolus with the same amount of poppy juice. juice of gentian too is used as ointment, and it is also used instead of poppy juice as an ingredient of the more pungent eye salves. euphorbeum too improves the vision of those whose eyes are anointed with it. the juice of the plantain is dropped into the eyes for ophthalmia. films are dispersed by aristolochia, by hiberis attached to the head, and by cinquefoil. fluxes and eye-diseases generally are made better by verbascum. to fluxes is applied peristereos in rose oil or vinegar. for cataract and film lozenges of cyclamen are dissolved and applied; the juice of peucedanum, as we have said, poppy juice and rose oil being added, is good for improving the vision and for films. psyllion rubbed on the forehead arrests fluxes.
