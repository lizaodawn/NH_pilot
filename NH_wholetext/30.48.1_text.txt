sleep is induced by wool grease with a morsel of myrrh diluted in two cyathi of wine, or else with goose grease and myrtle wine, by the cuckoo bird in a piece of hare's fur worn as an amulet or by a heron's beak worn as an amulet on the forehead in a piece of ass's hide. it is thought too that the beak of the heron by itself rinsed in wide has the same effect. sleep is kept away, on the contrary, by a dried bat's head worn as an amulet.
