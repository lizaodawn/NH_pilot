and so, god be praised, she bestowed healing powers on the vine in particular, not being satisfied with having richly supplied it with delicious flavours, perfumes, and unguents, in its omphacium, its oenanthe, and its massaris, which i have described in the proper places. man, she says, enjoys through me a very great amount of pleasure. it is i who create the juice of the grape and the oil of the olive, i who create dates and fruits in great variety. i am unlike mother earth, all of whose gifts must be earned by toil - ploughing by bulls, beating on threshing-floors, and then grinding between millstones, and all to produce food at some indefinite time and with immense labour. but my gifts are perfect before they leave me, and need no laborious preparation. they proffer themselves unasked, and if it be too much trouble to reach them, they actually fall of themselves. she has striven to outdo herself, in that she has created more for our benefit even than for our pleasure.
