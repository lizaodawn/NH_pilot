similarly, dust in woollens and in clothes breeds moths, especially if a spider is shut up with them; for being thirsty and sucking up all the moisture it increases the dryness. this is also noticed in papers. there is a kind of moths that carry their own coats in the same way as snails; but the moths have visible feet. if stripped of their coats they die, but if they grow up, they form a chrysalis. the wild fig-tree breeds fig-gnats; beetles are produced by the maggots of figs and of the pear tree, pine, dog-rose and rose. this poisonous creature brings its remedies with it — the wings have a healing power; but with these removed it is deadly. again, other kinds, namely gnats, are bred by a substance growing sour, and in fact white ones are found even in snow, and also in snow that has been lying for some time maggots, which in a moderate depth of snow at all events are ruddy — for even snow itself turns reddish with lapse of time; these have shaggy hair and are of considerable size, and torpid.
