it is clearly obvious that fish possess a sense of smell, as they are not all attracted by the same food, and they smell a thing before they seize it. some fish even when hiding in caves are driven out by a fisherman who smears the mouth of the crag with brine used in pickling - they run away as it were from the recognition of their own dead body; and they also flock together from the deep water to certain smells, for instance a burnt cuttlefish or polyp, which are thrown into wicker creels for this purpose. indeed the stench of a ship's bilge makes them flee far away, but most of all the blood of fishes. the polyp cannot be dragged away from the bait; but when a sprig of marjoram is brought near to it, it at once darts away from the scent. purple-fish also can be caught by means of things with a foul smell. as to the rest of the animal class who could have any doubt? snakes are driven away by the stench of burnt stag's horn, but especially by that of styrax-tree gum; the scent of marjoram or lime or sulphur kills ants. gnats seek for sour things and are not attracted by sweet things.
