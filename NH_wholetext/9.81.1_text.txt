the first person to devise a separate pond for lampreys was gaius hirrius, who added to the triumphal banquets of caesar lampreys to the number of 6000 - as a loan, because he would not exchange them for money or for any other commodity. his less than moderate country estate was sold by its fishponds for 4,000,000 sesterces. subsequently affection for individual fishes came into fashion. at baculo in the baiae district the pleader hortensius had a fishpond containing a lamprey which he fell so deeply in love with that he is believed to have wept when it expired. at the same country house drusus's wife antonia adorned her favourite lamprey with earrings, and its reputation made some people extremely eager to visit baculo.
