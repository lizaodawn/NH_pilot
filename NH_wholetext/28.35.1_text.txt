from milk is also made butter, among barbarian tribes accounted the choicest food, one that distinguishes the rich from the lower orders. mostly cow's milk is used (hence the name), but the richest comes from sheep's — it is also made from goat's — but in winter the milk is warmed, while in summer the butter is extracted merely by shaking it rapidly in a tall vessel. this has a small hole to admit the air, made just under the mouth, which is otherwise completely stopped. there is added a little water to make the milk turn sour. the part that curdles most, floating on the top, is skimmed off, and with salt added is called oxygala; the rest they boil down in pots. what comes to the surface is butter, a fatty substance. the stronger the taste, the more highly is butter esteemed. when matured it is used as an ingredient for several mixtures. it is by nature astringent, emollient, flesh-forming, and cleansing.
