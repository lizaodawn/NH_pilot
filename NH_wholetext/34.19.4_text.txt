polycleitus of sikyon, a pupil of hagelades, made a statue of the 'diadumenos' or binding his hair — a youth, but soft-looking — famous for having cost 100 talents, and also the 'doryphoros' or carrying a spear — a boy, but manly-looking. he also made what artists call a 'canon' or model statue, as they draw their artistic outlines from it as from a sort of standard; and he alone of mankind is deemed by means of one work of art to have created the art itself! he also made the statue of the man using a body-scraper ('apoxyomenos') and, in the nude, the man attacking with spear, and the two boys playing knucklebones, likewise in the nude, known by the greek name of astragalizontes and now standing in the forecourt of the emperor titus — this is generally considered to be the most perfect work of art in existence — and likewise the hermes that was once at lysimachea; heracles; the leader donning his armour, which is at rome; and artemon, called the man in the litter. polycleitus is deemed to have perfected this science of statuary and to have refined the art of carving sculpture, just as pheidias is considered to have revealed it. a discovery that was entirely his own is the art of making statues throwing their weight on one leg, although varro says these figures are of a square build and almost all made on one model.
