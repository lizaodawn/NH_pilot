but why do i mention these trifles when their moral corruption and luxury spring from no other source in greater abundance than from the genus shell-fish? it is true that of the whole of nature the sea is most detrimental to the stomach in a multitude of ways, with its multitude of dishes and of appetizing kinds of fish to which the profits made by those who catch them spell danger. but what proportion do these form when we consider purple and scarlet robes and pearls! it had been insufficient, forsooth, for the seas to be stowed into our gullets, were they not carded on the hands and in the ears and on the head and all over the body of women and men alike. what connexion is there between the sea and our clothing, between the waves and waters and woollen fabric? we only enter that element in a proper manner when we are naked! granted that there is so close an alliance between it and our stomach, but what has it to do with our backs? are we not content to feed on dangers without also being clothed with them? is it that the rule that we get most satisfaction from luxuries costing a human life to procure holds good for the whole of our anatomy?
