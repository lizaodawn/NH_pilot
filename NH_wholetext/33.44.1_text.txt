there are two points in which silver shows a variation. a shaving that remains perfectly white when placed on white-hot iron shovels is passed as good, while if it turns red it is of the next quality, and if black it has no value at all. but fraud has found its way even into this test; if the shovels are kept in men's urine the silver shaving is stained by it during the process of being burnt, and counterfeits whiteness. there is also one way of testing polished silver in a man's breath â€” if it at once forms surface moisture and dissipates the vapour.
