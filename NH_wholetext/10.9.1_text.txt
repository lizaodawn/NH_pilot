of hawks we find sixteen kinds, and among these the aegithus, which when lame in one foot is of very fortunate omen for marriage contracts and for property in cattle, and the triorchis, named from the number of its testicles, the bird to which phemonoe gave primacy among auguries. the roman name for it is buteo, which is also the surname of a family, assumed because one perched on an admiral's ship with good omen. the greeks give the name of merlin to the only species that appears at every season, whereas all the others go away in winter. the varieties of hawks are distinguished by their appetite for food: some only snatch a bird off the pound, others only one fluttering round a tree, others one that perches high in the branches, others one flying in the open. consequently even the doves know the risks that they run from hawks, and when they see one they alight, or else fly upward, safeguarding themselves by going counter to the hawk's nature. the hawks of the whole of massaesylia lay their eggs on the ground in cerne, an island of africa in the ocean, and they do not breed elsewhere, as they are accustomed to the natives of that island.
