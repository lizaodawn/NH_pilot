the elder cato, who was exceptionally celebrated for his triumph and his censorship, though yet more for his literary distinction and for the precepts that he has given to the roman nation upon every matter of utility, and in particular as to agriculture — a man who by the admission of his contemporaries was a supremely competent and unrivalled agriculturalist — has dealt with only a few varieties of the vine, including some even the names of which are now extinct. his opinion deserves to be set out separately and handled at full length, to make us acquainted with the varieties which were the most famous in the whole of this class in the year 154 bc., about the time of the taking of carthage and corinth, the period of cato's demise — and to show us how great an advance civilization has made in the subsequent 230 years. the following therefore are the remarks that he made on the subject of vines and grapes: 'in the locality pronounced to be best for the vine and fully exposed to the sun, you should plant the small variety of aminian and the double eugenium, and also the small helvia. in a denser soil or a locality more liable to fog you should plant the larger aminian or the murgentine, the apician, and the lucanian. all the other varieties of vine, especially hybrids, are suited to any kind of land. the small aminian grape and the larger one and the apician are stored unstoned in a jar; they can also be kept in new wine boiled down and must, and properly in after-wine. the larger aminian hard-berry grapes, which one you hang up, are properly kept, for instance at a blacksmith's forge, to make raisins. nor are there any older instructions on this subject written in latin, so near we are to the origin of things. the aminian grape last mentioned is called by varro the scantian.
