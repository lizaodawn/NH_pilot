a wine is also made of only water and honey. for this it is recommended that rainwater should be stored for five years. some who are more expert use rain-water as soon as it has fallen, boiling it down to a third of the quantity and adding one part of old honey to three parts of water, and then keeping the mixture in the sun for 40 days after the rising of the dog-star. others pour it off after nine days and then cork it up. this beverage is called in greek 'water-honey'; with age it attains the flavour of wine. it is nowhere rated more highly than in phrygia.
