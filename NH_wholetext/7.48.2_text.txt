but to pass to admitted facts, it is almost certain that argathonius of cadiz reigned for 80 years; his reign is thought to have begun in his fortieth year. it is not questioned that masinissa reigned 60 years and that the sicilian gorgias lived 108 years. quintus fabius maximus was augur for 63 years. marcus perperna and recently lucius volusius saturninus outlived all the persons whose votes in debate they had taken as consuls; perperna left only seven of those whom as censor he had elected — he lived to 98. in this matter it occurs to me to note also that there has only been a single five-year period in which no senator has died, from when flaccus and albinus as censors performed the purification ceremony to the next censors — beginning 175 b.c. marcus valerius corvinus completed 100 years, and there was an interval of 46 years between his first and sixth consulships. he also took his seat in the curule chair 21 times, which is a record; but his length of life was equalled by the pontifex metellus.
