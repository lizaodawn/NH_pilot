it is a common occurrence for fallen trees often to be replaced and to come back to life again owing to the earth forming a sort of scab over the wound. this is most common with plane trees, which hold a very large quantity of wind because of the density of their branches, which are lopped to relieve the trees of the weight and the trees are then replanted in their own hole; and this has before now also been done in the case of walnuts and olives and a number of other trees. there are also many cases of trees having fallen even without a storm or any other cause except one of a miraculous nature and having risen up again of their own accord. this portent occurred to the citizens of the roman nation during the cimbrian wars in the case of an elm in the grove of juno at nuceria, actually after its top had been lopped off because it was leaning forward right on to the altar; the tree was restored of its own accord so completely that it at once flowered, and from that date onward the majesty of the roman people recovered, after having previously been ravaged by disasters in war. it is recorded that this also happened at philippi with a willow that had fallen down and had been severed from its trunk, and at stagira with a white poplar in the shrine of the muses, all of these occurrences being of good omen. but most wonderful of all, a plane-tree at antandros recovered of its own accord and was restored to life even after its sides had been rough-hewn all round, a tree 22 1/2 feet high and 6 feet thick.
