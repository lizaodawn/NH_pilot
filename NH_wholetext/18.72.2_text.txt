the ear itself when reaped in some places is beaten out with threshing-sledges on a threshing-floor, in others by being trodden on by mares, and in other places it is thrashed out with flails. wheat is found to give a larger yield the later it is reaped, but to be of finer quality and stronger the earlier it is reaped. the most obvious rule is to reap it 'before the grain hardens and when it has begun to gain colour', but there is an oracular utterance, 'better to do your reaping two days too soon than two days too late.' common and bare wheats require the same method on the threshing-floor and in the granary. emmer being difficult to thresh is best stored with its chaff, and only has the straw and the beard removed. the majority of countries use chaff for hay; the thinner and finer it is and the nearer to dust, the better, and consequently the best chaff is obtained from millet, the next best from barley, and the worst from wheat, except for beasts that are being worked hard. in rocky places they leave straw to dry and then break it up with a flail, to use it as litter for cattle, but if there is a shortage of chaff the straw also is ground for fodder. the method is as follows: it is cut rather early, and sprinkled with strong brine and then dried and rolled up into trusses, and so fed to oxen instead of hay. some people also set fire to the stubble in the field, a process advertised by the high authority of virgil; their chief reason however for this plan is to burn up the seed of weeds. the size of the crops and scarcity of labour cause various procedures to be adopted.
