the theory of the winds having now in fact been set out, in order to avoid repetition it is the best plan to pass on to the remaining means of forecasting the weather, since i see that this subject also appealed greatly to virgil, inasmuch as he records that even in harvest time the winds often engage in battles that are ruinous to inexpert farmers. it is recorded that democritus above mentioned when his brother damasus was reaping his harvest, in extremely hot weather besought him to leave the rest of the crop and make haste to get what he had already cut under cover, his prophecy being confirmed a few hours later by a fierce storm of rain. moreover it is also recommended only to plant reeds when rain is impending and to sow corn when a shower is about to follow. we therefore briefly touch on these subjects also, examining the most relevant facts, and we will take first weather forecasts derived from the sun.
