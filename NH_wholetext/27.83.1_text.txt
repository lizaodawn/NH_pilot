natrix is the name of a plant the root of which, when pulled up, gives out the foul smell of he-goats. in picenum they use this plant to drive away from women what are, with a strange credulity, called fatui. i myself should believe that it is the hallucination of minds delirious in this way that is helped by such a drugs.
