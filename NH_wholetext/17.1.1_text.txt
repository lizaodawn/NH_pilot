we have now stated the nature of the trees that grow of their own accord on land and in the sea; and there remain those which owe what is more truly described as their formation than their birth to art and to the ingenious devices of mankind. but it is in place first to express surprise at the way in which the trees that, under the niggardly system that we have recorded, were held in common ownership by the wild animals, with man doing battle with them for the fruit that fell to the ground and also with the birds for that which still hung on the tree, have come to command such high prices as articles of luxury — the most famous instance, in my judgement, being the affair of lucius crassus and gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus. crassus was one of the leading roman orators; he owned a splendid mansion, but it was considerably surpassed by another that was also on the palatine hill, belonging to quintus catulus, the colleague of gaius marius [102 bce] in the defeats of the cimbrians; while by far the finest house of that period was by universal agreement the one on the viminal hill owned by gaius aquilius, knight of rome, who was even more celebrated for this property than he was for his knowledge of civil law, although nevertheless in the case of crassus his mansion was considered a reproach to him. crassus and domitius both belonged to families of high distinction, and they were colleagues as consuls and afterwards, in 92 b.c., as censors: owing to their dissimilarity of character their tenure of the censorship was filled with quarrels between them. on the occasion referred to, gnaeus domitius, being a man of hasty temper and moreover inflamed by that particularly sour kind of hatred which springs out of rivalry, gave crassus a severe rebuke for living on so expensive a scale when holding the office of censor, and repeatedly declared that he would give a million sesterces for his mansion; and crassus, who always had a ready wit and was good at clever repartees, replied that he accepted the bid, with the reservation of half a dozen trees. domitius declined to buy the place even for a shilling without the timber. 'well then,' said crassus, 'tell me pray, domitius, am i the one who is setting a bad example and who deserves a mark of censure from the very office which i am myself occupying — i, who live quite unpretentiously in the house that came to me by inheritance, or is it you, who price six trees at a million sesterces?' the trees referred to were nettle-trees, with an exuberance of spreading, shady branches; caecina largus, one of the great gentlemen of rome, in our young days used frequently to point them out in the mansion, of which he was then the owner, and they lasted — as we have already also spoken of the limits of longevity in trees — down to the emperor nero's conflagration, [ad 64] thanks to careful tendance still verdant and vigorous, had not the emperor mentioned hastened the death even of trees. and let nobody suppose that crassus's mansion was in other respects a poor affair, and that it contained nothing beside trees to attract this provoking bid from domitius; on the contrary, he had already erected for decorative purposes in the court of the mansion six pillars of marble from mt. hymettus, which in view of his aedileship he had imported to embellish the stage of the theatre — and this although hitherto there were no marble pillars in any public place: of so recent a date is luxurious wealth! and at that date so much greater distinction was added to mansions by trees that domitius actually would not keep to the price suggested by a quarrel without the timber in question being thrown in.
