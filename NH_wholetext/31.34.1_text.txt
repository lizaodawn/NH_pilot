i am well aware that to inland dwellers these remarks may appear superfluous, but research has provided for this also by discovering a method whereby every man may make sea water for himself. in this method there is one strange feature: if more than a sextarius of salt is dropped into four sextarii of water, the water is overpowered, and the salt does not dissolve. however, a sextarius of salt and four sextarii of water give the strength and properties of the saltest sea. but it is thought that the most reasonable proportion is to compound the measure of water given above with eight cyathi of salt. this mixture warms the sinews without chafing the skin.
