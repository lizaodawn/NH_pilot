of the apple class there are a number varieties. we have spoken of citrons when describing the citron-tree; the greeks, however, call them 'medic apples,' after their native country. equally foreign are the jujube-tree and the tuber-apple, which themselves also have only recently come into italy, the former from africa and the latter from syria. sextus papinius, who was consul in our own day [ad 23], introduced each of them in the last years of the principate of his late majesty augustus, having grown them in his camp from slips; the fruit is more like a berry than an apple, but the trees make a particularly good decoration for terraces - as nowadays we have whole forests of vegetation growing even over the roofs of our houses. there are two kinds of tuber-apple, the white and the red syrian, so called from its colour. the fruit called wool-fruit, growing in the district of verona but nowhere else in italy, is virtually an exotic; it is covered with a woolly down, which grows also in very large quantities on the sparrow-quince and the peach, but which has given its name to this fruit in particular as it has no other remarkable property to recommend it.
