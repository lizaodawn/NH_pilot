caucalis too is edible, a plant like fennel, with a short stem and a white flower. it is good for the heart; its juice too is taken as a draught, being especially good for the stomach and urine, for expelling stone and gravel, and for irritation of the bladder. it alleviates also catarrhs of the spleen, liver and kidneys. the seed promotes menstruation, and dries up bilious secretions after childbirth. it is also prescribed for seminal fluxes in men. chrysippus is also of opinion that it greatly helps conception. it is taken in wine fasting. it is also applied to the wounds caused by poisonous sea creatures, as petrichus points out in his poem.
