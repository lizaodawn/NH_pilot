all these occurrences are due to a plurality of causes. the first is the factor of the circles which in the case of the stars the greeks designate apsides or arcs (it will be necessary to employ greek terms). each planet has its own circle, and these are not the same as those of the firmament, since the earth between the two vertices, named in greek poles, is the centre of the sky, and also of the zodiac, which is situated on a slant between the poles. [all these facts are always established beyond doubt by the method of compasses.] therefore the special arc of each is drawn from a different centre, and consequently they have different orbits and dissimilar motions, because the inner arcs must necessarily be shorter.
