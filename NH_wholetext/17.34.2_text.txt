the sessile-fruited oak is grown in a similar way, though later by three years in lopping, and less difficult to propagate in whatever soil it is sown; this is done in spring, with an acorn (but only a sessile-oak is grown from one) in a hole nine inches deep, with two foot spaces between the plants; the ground is lightly hoed four times a year. a sessile-oak grown as a prop is least liable to rot, and it makes new shoots when lopped most of any timber. timber trees in addition to those we have mentioned are the ash, laurel, peach, hazel, apple, but these shoot more slowly and when fixed in the ground scarcely stand the action of the soil, not to mention the damp. the elder, on the contrary, which is very strong timber for a stake, is grown from cuttings like the poplar. about the cypress we have already said enough.
