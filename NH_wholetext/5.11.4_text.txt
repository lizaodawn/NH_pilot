there are also, in the latter part of the course of the nile, many towns of considerable celebrity, and more especially those which have given their names to the mouths of the river â€” i do not mean, all the mouths, for there are no less than twelve of them, as well as four others, which the people call the false mouths. i allude to the seven more famous ones, the canopic mouth, next to alexandria, those of bolbitine, sebennys, phatnis, mendes, tanis, and, last of all, pelusium. besides the above there are the towns of butos, pharbaethos, leontopolis, athribis, the town of isis, busiris, cynopolis, aphrodites, sais, and naucratis, from which last some writers call that the naucratitic mouth, which is by others called the heracleotic, and mention it instead of the canopic mouth, which is the next to it.
