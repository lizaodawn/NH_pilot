the nature of remedies, and the great number of those already described or waiting to be described, compel me to say more about the art of medicine itself, although i am aware that no one hitherto has treated the subject in latin, and that the judgement passed on all new endeavours is uncertain, especially on such as arc barren of all charm, and the difficulty of setting them forth is so great. but since it is likely to come into the minds of all students of the subject to ask why ever things ready to hand and appropriate have become obsolete in medical practice, the thought occurs at once that it is both a wonder and a shame that none of the arts has been more unstable, or even now more often changed, although none is more profitable. to its pioneers medicine assigned a place among the gods and a home in heaven, and even today medical aid is in many ways sought from the oracle. then medicine became more famous even through sin, for legend said that aesculapius was struck by lightning for bringing tyndareus back to life. but medicine did not cease to give out that by its agency other men had come to life again, being famous in trojan times, in which its renown was more assured, but only for the treatment of wounds.
