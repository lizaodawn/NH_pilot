among the plants that like cold conditions it may also be proper to have the aquatic shrubs mentioned. the primacy among these will be held by the reeds, which are indispensable for the practices of war and of peace and are also acceptable for our amusement. the northern peoples thatch their homes with reeds, and roofs of this kind last for ages, while in other parts of the world as well reeds also provide very light ceilings for rooms. and reeds serve as pens for writing on paper, especially egyptian reeds owing to their kinship as it were with the papyrus; although the reeds of cnidus and those that grow round the anaetic lake in asia are more esteemed. those of our country have a more fungous substance underneath the surface, made of spongy cartilage which has a hollow structure inside and a thin, dry, woody surface, and easily breaks into splinters which always have an extremely sharp edge. for the rest it is of a slender appearance, jointed and divided with knots and tapering gradually off to the top with a rather thick tuft of hair, which also is not without value, as it either serves instead of feathers to stuff the beds of innkeepers, or in places where it grows very hard and woody in structure, as in belgium, it is pounded up and inserted between the joints of ships to caulk the seams, holding better than glue and being more reliable for filling cracks than pitch.
