there must be no hurry to prune a young vine, but at first the growth should be collected together into circular shapes, and no pruning should be applied except to a strong plant, a vine trained on a tree being about a year later in bearing fruit than one trained on a cross-bar. some people forbid pruning altogether until the vine equals the tree in height. at the first pruning it should be cut back six feet from the ground, a shoot being left below and encouraged to grow by bending over the wood. it should have three buds and not more left when it has been pruned. in the following year the branches sent out from these should be spread out on the lowest stages of the trees and allowed to climb to the next higher level every year, one hard growth being always left at each stage, and one growing shoot left to mount up as high as it pleases. in addition, all the whips that have borne fruit last time should. be cut back by pruning, and fresh shoots should have their tendrils cut away all round and be spread out on the stages. our italian method of pruning drapes the tree with tresses of vines festooned along the branches and clothes the tresses themselves with bunches of grapes, but the gallic method spreads out into growths passing from tree to tree, while the method used on the aemilian road spreads over supports consisting of atinian elms, twining round them but avoiding their foliage.
