a herb of exceptionally remarkable nature is black-herb, the greek name for which is horse-parsley, and which others call zmyrnium. it is reproduced from the gum that trickles from its own stalk, but it can also be grown from a root. the people who collect its juice say that it tastes like myrrh, and theophrastus states that it sprang first from sown myrrh seed. old writers had recommended sowing horse-parsley in uncultivated stony ground near a garden wall; but at the present day it is sown in land that has been dug over and also after a west wind has followed the autumn equinox. the reason for the old plan was that the caper also is sown principally in dry places, after a plot has been hollowed out for deep digging and stone banks have been built all round it: otherwise it strays all over the fields and takes the fertility out of the soil. it blossoms in summer and continues green till the setting of the pleiades; it is most at home in sandy soil. the bad qualities of the caper that grows over seas we have spoken of among the exotic shrubs.
