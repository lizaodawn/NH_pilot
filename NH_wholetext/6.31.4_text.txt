below this district is susiane, in which is the city of susa, the ancient residence of the kings of persia, built by darius, the son of hystaspes; it is distant from seleucia babylonia four hundred and fifty miles, and the same from ecbatana of the medi, by way of mount carbantus. upon the northern channel of the river tigris is the town of babytace, distant from susa one hundred and thirty-five miles. here, for the only place in all the world, is gold held in abhorrence; the people collect it together and bury it in the earth, that it may be of use to no one. on the east of susiane are the oxii, a predatory people, and forty independent savage tribes of the mizaei. above these are the mardi and the saitae, subject to parthia: they extend above the district of elymais, which we have already mentioned as joining up to the coast of persis. susa is distant two hundred and fifty miles from the persian sea. near the spot where the fleet of alexander came up the pasitigris to susa, there is a village situate on the chaldaean lake, aple by name, from which to susa is a distance of sixty miles and a half. adjoining to the people of susiane, on the east, are the cossiei; and above them, to the north, is mesabatene, lying at the foot of mount cambalidus, a branch of the caucasian chain: from this point the country of the bactri is most accessible.
