the skin of the hippopotamus is so thick that it is used for the points of spears, and yet its mind possesses a certain medical ability. the hides of elephants also supply impenetrable bucklers (though nevertheless they are credited with the most outstanding mental subtlety of all quadrupeds); and consequently their skin itself is devoid of sensation, especially in the head. it does not heal up when wounded in any place where there is only skin and no flesh, as in the cheek and eyelid.
