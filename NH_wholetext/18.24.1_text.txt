millet flourishes particularly well in campania, where it is used for making a white porridge; it also makes extremely sweet bread. moreover the sarmatian tribes live chiefly on millet porridge, and even on the raw meal, mixed with mare's milk or with blood taken from the veins in a horse's leg. millet and barley are the only grains known to the ethiopians.
