cisterns should be made of five parts of clean, coarse sand to two of the hottest possible quicklime, together with pieces of silex each weighing not more than a pound. the floor and walls built of this material should all alike be beaten with iron bars. it is better to build cisterns in pairs so that impurities may settle in the first, and water pass through a filter purified into the adjoining one.
