many insects however are born in other ways as well, and in the first place from dew. at the beginning of spring this lodges on the leaf of a radish and is condensed by the sun and shrinks to the size of a millet seed. out of this a small maggot develops, and three days later it becomes a caterpillar, which as days are added grows larger; it becomes motionless, with a hard skin, and only moves when touched, being covered with a cobweb growth - at this stage it is called a chrysalis. then it bursts its covering and flies out as a butterfly.
