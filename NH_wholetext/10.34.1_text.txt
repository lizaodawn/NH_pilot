swallows, the only flesh-eating bird among those that have not hooked talons, also migrate in the winter months; but they only retire to places near at hand, making for the sunny gulleys in the mountains, and they have before now been found there moulted and bare of feathers. it is said that they do not enter under the roofs of thebes, because that city has been so often captured, nor at bizye in thrace on account of the crimes of tereus. a man of knightly rank at volaterrae, caecina, who owned a racing four-in-hand, used to catch swallows and take them with him to rome and despatch them to take the news of a win to his friends, as they returned to the same nest; they had the winning colour painted on them. also fabius pictor records in his annals that when a roman garrison was besieged by the ligurians a swallow taken from her nestlings was brought to him for him to indicate by knots made in a thread tied to its foot how many days later help would arrive and a sortie must be made.
