the aquatic animals clad with hair are viviparous - for instance the saw-fish, the whale and the seal. the last bears its young on land; it produces afterbirth like cattle; in coupling it clings together as dogs do; it sometimes gives birth to more than two in a litter; it rears its young at the breast; it does not lead them down into the sea before the twelfth day, thereafter continually accustoming them to it. seals are with difficulty killed unless the head is shattered. of themselves they make a noise like lowing, whence their name 'sea-calves'; yet they are capable of training, and can be taught to salute the public with their voice and at the same time with bowing, and when called by name to reply with a harsh roar. no animal sleeps more heavily. the fins that they use in the sea also serve them on land as feet to crawl with. their hides even when flayed from the body are said to retain a sense of the tides, and always to bristle when the tide is going out; and it is also said that the right fin possesses a soporific influence, and when placed under the head attracts sleep. two only of the hairless animals are viviparous, the dolphin and the viper.
