thorns and similar objects are extracted by a cat's excrements, also by a she-goat's in wine, by any kind of rennet but especially by hare's with powdered frankincense and oil, or else with an equal weight of mistletoe, or with bee glue. black scars are brought back to the original colour by ass's suet, and made fainter by warmed calf's gall. physicians add myrrh, honey and saffron, and keep in a bronze box; some add to the mixture flower of bronze.
