they also import from carmania the stobrus tree, to use for the purpose of fumigation; it is soaked in palm wine and then set alight. the vapour is thrown back from the ceiling to the floor; it has an agreeable scent, but it causes headache, which is not however severe enough to be painful: it is used as a soporific for invalids. for these trades they have opened up the city of carrhae, which is the market town of these parts. from carrhae everybody used formerly to go on to gabba, a journey of twenty days, and to palestine in syria; but afterwards, according to juba, they began to make for charax and the parthian kingdom for the sake of the perfume trade. but my own view is that they used to convey those commodities to the persians even before they took them to syria or egypt, this being attested by herodotus, who records that the arabs used regularly to pay a yearly tribute of a thousand talents of incense to the kings of the persians. from syria they bring back styrax, which they burn on their hearths, for its powerful scent to dispel their dislike for their own scents. for the rest, no other kinds of wood are in use among them except those that are scented; and the sabaei even cook their food with incense-wood, and other tribes with that of the myrrh-tree, so that the smoke and vapour of their towns and districts is just like that which rises from altars. in order therefore to remedy this smell they obtain styrax in goatskins and fumigate their houses with it: so true it is that there is no pleasure the continued enjoyment of which does not engender disgust. they also burn styrax to drive away the snakes which abound in the forests of perfume-producing trees.
