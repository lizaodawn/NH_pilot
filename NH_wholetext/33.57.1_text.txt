the blue pigment is a sand. in old days there were three varieties: the egyptian is thought most highly of; next the scythian mixes easily with water, and changes into four colours when ground, lighter or darker and coarser or finer; to this blue the cyprian is now preferred. to these were added the pozzuoli blue, and the spanish blue, when blue sand-deposits began to be worked in those places. every kind however undergoes a dyeing process, being boiled with a special plant and absorbing its juice; but the remainder of the process of manufacture is the same as with gold-solder.
