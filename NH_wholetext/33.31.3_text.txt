silver is found in almost all the provinces, but the finest is in spain, where it, as well as gold, occurs in sterile ground and even in the mountains; and wherever one vein is found another is afterwards found not far away. this indeed also occurs in the ease of almost every metal, and accounts it seems for the word metals used by the greeks. it is a remarkable fact that the shafts initiated by hannibal all over the spanish provinces are still in existence; they are named from the persons who discovered them; one of these mines, now called after baebelo, furnished hannibal with 300 pounds weight of silver a day, the tunnelling having been carried a mile and a half into the mountain. along the whole of this distance watermen are posted who all night and day in spells measured by lanterns bale out the water and make a stream. the vein of silver nearest the surface is called the 'raw.' in early days the excavations used to stop when they found alum, and no further search made; but recently the discovery of a vein of copper under the alum has removed all limit to men's hopes. the exhalations from silver mines are dangerous to all animals, but specially to dogs. gold and silver are more beautiful the softer they are. it surprises most people that silver traces black lines.
