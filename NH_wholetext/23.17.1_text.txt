there is then also a dark vine, which is the one properly named bryony, called by some chironia, by others gynaecanthe or apronia, similar to the preceding except for the colour; for that is, as i have said, dark. diocles preferred its shoots to the real asparagus as a food for promoting urine and reducing the spleen. it is to be found growing mostly in shrubberies and reed beds. its root is dark outside, but inside of the colour of box-wood. splintered bones are extracted by it even more effectively than by the vine mentioned above; in other respects it has the same properties. it is a special feature of it that it is a specific for the sores that come on the necks of beasts of burden. it is said that if one grows it round a country house hawks keep away, and the poultry are kept safe. it also heals, in beast or man, if tied round the ankles, congestion of blood that may have settled there. so much then for the various kinds of vines.
