some branches are without eyes and do not form buds, this being a natural consequence of their not having fully developed, or else a penalty when a scar inflicted in pruning has blunted their powers. in a vine the eye and in a reed the joint contain the same nature that trees which spread out have in their branch. with all trees the parts nearest the pound are thicker. the fir, the larch, the palm, the cypress, the elm and all the trees with a single trunk make their growth in the direction of height. among the branching trees the cherry is found making timbers as much as 20 yards long and a yard thick for the whole length. some trees spread out into branches at once, for example apples.
