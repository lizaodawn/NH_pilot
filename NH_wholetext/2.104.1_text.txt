the moon on the contrary is said to be a feminine and soft star, and to disengage moisture at night and attract, not remove it. the proof given for this is that the moon by her aspect melts the bodies of wild animals that have been killed and causes them to putrefy, and that when people are fast asleep she recalls the torpor and collects it into the head, and thaws ice, and unstiffens everything with moistening breath: thus (it is said) nature's alternations are held in balance, and there is always a supply, some of the stars drawing the elements together while others scatter them. but the nutriment of the moon is stated to be contained in bodies of fresh water as that of the sun is in seawater.
