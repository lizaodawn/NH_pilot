the wild myrtle, oxymyrsine or chamaemyrsine, is distinguished from the cultivated by its red berries and small size. its root is much esteemed. a decoction in wine is taken for pains in the kidneys and for strangury, particularly when the urine is thick and of foul odour; for jaundice and purging the uterus it is pounded with wine. the young stalks also are cooked in ashes and taken as food in the same way as asparagus. the berries, taken with wine or with oil and vinegar, break up stone in the bladder; pounded also in vinegar and rose oil it relieves headache, and taken in drink the jaundice. castor gave the name of ruscum [butcher's broom] to the oxymyrsine, having leaves which are a myrtle's but prickly, from which in the country they make brooms; its medicinal properties are the same. so much for the medicines derived from cultivated trees of our cities; lei me pass on to the wild ones of the woods.
