it must be agreed that creatures enclosed in a flinty shell, such as oysters, have no senses. many have the same nature as a bush, for instance the sea-cucumber, the sea-lung, the starfish. and to no such an extent is it the case that everything grows in the sea, that even the creatures found in inns in summertime — those that plague us with a quick jump or those that hide chiefly in the hair — occur there, and are often drawn out of the water clustering round the bait; and their irritation is thought to disturb the sleep of fish in the sea at night. indeed on some kinds of fish these vermin actually breed as parasites; the herring is believed to be one of these.
