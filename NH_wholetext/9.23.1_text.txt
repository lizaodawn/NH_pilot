female fish are larger than the males. in one kind there are no males at all, as is the case with red mullet and sea-perch, for all those caught are heavy with eggs. almost every kind with scales is gregarious. fish are caught before sunrise; at that of hour their sight is most fallible. in the night they repose, but on bright nights they can see as well as by day. people also say that scraping the bottom helps the catch, and that consequently more are caught at the second haul than at the first. fish are fondest of the taste of oil, but next to that they enjoy and derive nourishment from moderate falls of rain: in fact even reeds although growing in a marsh nevertheless do not grow up without rain; and besides, fishes everywhere die when kept continually in the same water, if there is no inflow.
