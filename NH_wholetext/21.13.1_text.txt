in lily-culture a strange means of dyeing the blooms has been invented by the wit of man. for in the month of july drying stems of the lily are tied together and hung in the smoke. then, as the little knots bare themselves, these stems in march are steeped in the lees of dark wine or greek wine, so that they take on the colour. in this state they are planted in little trenches, with a hemina of lees poured round each. in this way bright-red lilies are produced, and it is wonderful that a plant can be so dyed as to grow a bloom that is also dyed.
