it remains to return from these plants to the cultivation of gardens, a subject recommended to our notice both by its own intrinsic nature and by the fact that antiquity gave its highest admiration to the garden of the hesperids and of the kings adonis and alcinous, and also to hanging gardens, whether those constructed by semiramis or by syrus king of assyria, about whose work we shall speak in another volume. the kings of rome indeed cultivated their gardens with their own hands; in fact it was from his garden that even tarquin the proud sent that cruel and bloodthirsty message to his son. in our laws of the twelve tables the word 'farm' never occurs â€” the word 'garden' is always used in that sense, while a garden is denoted by 'family estate'. consequently even a certain sense of sanctity attached to a garden, and only in a garden and in the forum do we see statues of satyrs dedicated as a charm against the sorcery of the envious, although plautus speaks of gardens as being under the guardianship of venus. nowadays indeed under the name of gardens people possess the luxury of regular farms and country houses actually within the city. this practice was first introduced at athens by that connoisseur of luxurious ease, epicurus; down to his day the custom had not existed of having country dwellings in towns.
