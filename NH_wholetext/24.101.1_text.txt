the same pythagoras calls aproxis a plant whose root catches fire at a distance like naphtha; i have spoken about it in my section on the marvels of the earth. he also informs us that the symptoms of diseases which have attacked the human body when the cabbage a is in blossom, even though the patient has been cured, are felt to recur every time this plant blossoms; he speaks of a similar peculiarity following diseases which have attacked when wheat, hemlock or the violet is in flower. i am aware that this book of his is ascribed by some to the physician cleemporus, but an ancient and unbroken tradition assigns it to pythagoras. were the author anyone else, the mere fact that he has considered the result of his labour worthy of that great thinker enhances the authority of a book; but who would believe that cleemporus acted so, since he published other works, and that under his own name?
