when we think of these things we feel ourselves blushing prodigiously with shame even for the men of former times. there exist the laws passed by claudius in his censorship forbidding dormice and other trifles too insignificant to mention to be served at dinner. but no law was ever passed forbidding us to import marble and to traverse the seas for its sake. perhaps it may be said 'of course not. no marbles were being imported.' that suggestion at least is untrue. in the aedileship of marcus scaurus there was the spectacle of 360 columns being taken to the stage of an improvised theatre that was intended to be used barely for a month, and the laws were silent. of course, it was the official pleasures of the community for which some allowance was being made by our laws. but why should this, of all excuses, have been made? or what route is more commonly taken by vices in their surreptitious approach than the official one? how else have ivory, gold and precious stones come to be used in private life? or what have we left entirely to the gods? very well; some allowance was being made for the pleasures of the community. were not the laws silent also when the largest of those columns, which were each fully 38 feet long and of lucullean marble, were placed in the hall of scaurus' house?
