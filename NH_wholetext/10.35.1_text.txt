blackbirds, thrushes and starlings also migrate in a similar way to neighbouring districts; but these do not moult their plumage, and do not go into hiding, being often seen in the places where they forage for winter food. consequently in germany thrushes are most often seen in winter. the turtledove goes into hiding in a truer sense, and moults its feathers. woodpigeons also go into retreat, though in their case also it is not certain exactly where. it is a peculiarity of the starling kind that they fly in flocks and wheel round in a sort of circular ball, all making towards the centre of the flock. the swallow is the only bird that has an extremely swift and swerving flight, owing to which it is also not liable to capture by the other kinds of birds. also the swallow is the only bird that only feeds when on the wing.
