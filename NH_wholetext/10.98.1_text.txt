man when born is beset by sleep for some months, and then day by day his waking period gets longer. an infant begins to dream at once, for it wakes up in a fright, and also imitates sucking. but some children never dream, and with these we find instances in which their dreaming contrary to their usual habit was a sign of approaching death. here an important topic invites us and one fully supplied with arguments on both sides â€” whether there are certain cases of foreknowledge present in the mind during repose, and what causes them, or whether it is a matter of chance like most things. if the question be argued by instances, these would doubtless be found to be equal on both sides. it is practically agreed that dreams occurring directly after drinking wine and eating food, and those that come in dozing off to sleep a second time, are false; but sleep is really nothing but the retirement of the mind into its innermost self. it is manifest that, beside human beings, horses, dogs, oxen, sheep and goats dream; it is consequently believed that, dreams also occur in all viviparous species. as to the oviparous creatures it is uncertain, but it is certain that they sleep. but let us also pass to insects, for these remain creatures of immeasurably minute structure.
