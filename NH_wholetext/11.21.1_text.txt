also an echo is detrimental to bees with its repercussion that alarms them by striking them with an alternating blow; fog too is detrimental. also spiders are in the highest degree hostile; when they have succeeded in weaving a web over the combs they kill the grubs. even the moth, that cowardly and ignoble creature that flutters up to lamps when they are lit, brings disaster, and not in one way only, for it both devours the combs itself and leaves excrement from which grubs are produced; also wherever it walks it weaves a covering of cobwebs chiefly made from the down on its wings. moreover moths are born in the wood itself that specially attack the combs. and another bane is their greed for food, as their belly is moved, specially in the spring time, by their devouring a surfeit of flowers. olive oil indeed kills not only bees but all insects, especially if they are placed in the sun after their head has been anointed. sometimes also they themselves cause their own death, by greedily devouring honey when they perceive that it is being taken away, whereas normally they are extremely thrifty and make a practice of driving away wasteful and greedy bees just the same as lazy and slothful ones. also their own honey is noxious to them, and if it is smeared on their backs they die. to so many foes and so many disasters - and how small a fraction of them i am recounting! - is this beneficent creature exposed. the remedies we will speak of in their proper places; for at present we are discussing their nature.
