the vicapervica, otherwise chamaedaphne, dried and crushed is given in water for dropsy in doses of a small spoonful, under which treatment the patient very quickly loses the water. a decoction of it in ash and sprinkled with wine dries tumours. its juice cures complaints of the ears. an application to the belly is said to be very beneficial indeed for diarrhoea.
