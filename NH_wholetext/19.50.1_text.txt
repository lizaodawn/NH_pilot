lovage grows wild in the mountains of its native liguria, but is cultivated everywhere; the cultivated kind is sweeter but lacks strength. some people call it panax, but the greek writer crateuas gives that name to cow-cunila, though all others call that conyra, which is really cunilago, while real cunila they call thymbra. with us cunila has another name also being called satureia and classed as a spice. it is sown in february; and it is a rival of wild marjoram, the two never being used as ingredients together, because they impart a similar flavour; but only the egyptian wild marjoram is reckoned superior to cunila.
