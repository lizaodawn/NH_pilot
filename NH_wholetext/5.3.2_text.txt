here commences the second division of africa properly so called. those who inhabit byzacium have the name of libyphoenices. byzacium is the name of a district which is 250 miles in circumference, and is remarkable for its extreme fertility, as the ground returns the seed sown by the husbandman with interest a hundred-fold. here are the free towns of leptis, adrumetum, ruspina, and thapsus; and then thenae, macomades, tacape, and sabrata which touches on the lesser syrtis; to which spot, from the ampsaga, the length of numidia and africa is 580 miles, and the breadth, so far as it has been ascertained, 200. that portion which we have called africa is divided into two provinces, the old and the new; these are separated by a dyke which was made by order of the second scipio africanus and the kings, and extended to thenae, which town is distant from carthage 216 miles.
