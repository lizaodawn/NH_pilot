but in italy also it is believed that the sight of wolves is harmful, and that if they look at a man before he sees them, it temporarily deprives him of utterance. the wolves produced in africa and egypt are feeble and small, but those of colder regions are cruel and fierce. we are bound to pronounce with confidence that the story of men being turned into wolves and restored to themselves again is false â€” or else we must believe all the tales that the experience of so many centuries has taught us to be fabulous; nevertheless we will indicate the origin of the popular belief, which is so firmly rooted that it classes werewolves among persons under a curse. evanthes, who holds no contemptible position among the authors of greece, writes that the arcadians have a tradition that someone chosen out of the clan of a certain anthus by casting lots among the family is taken to a certain marsh in that region, and hanging his clothes on an oak-tree swims across the water and goes away into a desolate place and is transformed into a wolf and herds with the others of the same kind for nine years; and that if in that period he has refrained from touching a human being, he returns to the same marsh, swims across it and recovers his shape, with nine years' age added to his former appearance; evanthes also adds the more fabulous detail that he gets back the same clothes. it is astounding to what lengths greek credulity will go; there is no lie so shameless as to lack a supporter. similarly apollas the author of olympic victors relates that at the sacrifice which even at that date the arcadians used to perform in honour of lycaean zeus with a human victim, daemenetus of parrhasia tasted the vitals of a boy who had been offered as a victim and turned himself into a wolf, and furthermore that he was restored ten years later and trained himself in athletics for boxing and returned a winner from olympia. moreover it is popularly believed that even the tail of this animal contains a love-poison in a small tuft of hair, and when it is caught it sheds the tuft, which has not the same potency unless plucked from the animal while it is alive; that the days on which it breeds are not more than twelve in a whole year; also that for it to feed on earth when it is hungry counts as an augury: if it does this in large mouthfuls when barring the path of travellers who come upon it on their right hand side, this is the finest of all omens. some members of the genus are called stag-wolves; a specimen from gaul was seen in the arena of pompey the great, as we have stated. they say that if this animal while devouring its food looks behind it, however hungry it is, forgetfulness of what it is eating creeps over it and it goes off to look for something else.
