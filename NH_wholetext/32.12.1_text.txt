as to the hostility between things, which the greeks call antipathia, there is nowhere anything more venomous than the stingray in the sea, since we have said that by its ray trees are killed. the galeos however chases the stingray, and also indeed other fishes, but the sting-ray in particular, just as on land the weasel chases serpents, so great is its greed for the very poison itself. those however stung by the sting-ray find good treatment in the galeos, as well as in red mullet and laser.
