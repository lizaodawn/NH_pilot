the more famous towns in lesser armenia are caesarea, aza, and nicopolis; in the greater arsamosata, which lies near the euphrates, carcathiocerta upon the tigris, tigranocerta which stands on an elevated site, and, on a plain adjoining the river araxes, artaxata. according to aufidius, the circumference of the whole of armenia is five thousand miles, while claudius caesar makes the length, from dascusa to the borders of the caspian sea, thirteen hundred miles, and the breadth, from tigranocerta to iberia, half that distance. it is a well-known fact, that this country is divided into prefectures, called "strategies," some of which singly formed a kingdom in former times; they are one hundred and twenty in number, with barbarous and uncouth names. on the east, it is bounded, though not immediately, by the ceraunian mountains and the district of adiabene. the space that intervenes is occupied by the sopheni, beyond whom is the chain of mountains, and then beyond them the inhabitants of adiabene. dwelling in the valleys adjoining to armenia are the menobardi and the moscheni. the tigris and inaccessible mountains surround adiabene. to the left of it is the territory of the medi, and in the distance is seen the caspian sea; which, as we shall state in the proper place, receives its waters from the ocean, and is wholly surrounded by the caucasian mountains. the inhabitants upon the confines of armenia shall now be treated of.
