the recipe for making unguents contains two ingredients, the juice and the solid part, the former which usually consists of various sorts of oil and the latter of scented substances, the oils being called 'astringents' and the scents 'sweetenings.' together with these there is a third factor that many people neglect - that of colour, for the sake of which cinnabar and alkanet should be added. a sprinkle of salt serves to preserve the properties of the oil, but to scents containing an admixture of alkanet salt is not added. resin or gum are added to retain the scent in the solid part, as it evaporates and disappears very quickly if these are not added.
