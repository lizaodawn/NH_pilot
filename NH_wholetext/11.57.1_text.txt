not all species have eyelids either, and also only viviparous creatures can wink. the heavier birds close the eye with the lower lid, and also wink with a skin that covers the eye from the corner. pigeons and similar birds close the eyes with both lids. but oviparous quadrupeds, such as tortoises and crocodiles, do so only with the lower lid, without any winking because their eyes are extremely hard. the old name for the edge of the upper eyelid was cilium; hence our word for the brows. when the eyelid is cleft by a wound it does not grow together again, as is the case with a few other parts of the human body.
