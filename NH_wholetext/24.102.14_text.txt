apollodorus, a follower of democritus, added to these plants one that he called aeschynomene, because on the approach of a hand it contracts its leaves, and another called crocis, whose touch, he declares, kills poisonous spiders; crateuas added the onothuris, by the sprinkling of which in wine he asserted that the fierceness of all animals is calmed; and a little while ago a well-known grammarian added anacampseros, by the mere touch of which, he said, love was restored, even though the lovers parted in hatred. these few remarks are quite enough to have been said for the present about the wonderful powers ascribed to plants by the magi, as i shall speak of them again on a more fitting occasion.
