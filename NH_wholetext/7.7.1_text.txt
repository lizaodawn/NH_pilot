one feels pity and even shame in realizing how trivial is the origin of the proudest of the animals, when the smell of lamps being put out usually causes abortion! these are the beginnings from which are born tyrants and the pride that deals slaughter. you who put confidence in your bodily strength, you who accept fortune's bounty and deem yourself not even her nurseling but her offspring, you whose thoughts are of empire, you who when swelling with some success believe yourself a god, could you have been made away with so cheaply? and even today you can be more cheaply, from being bitten by a snake's tiny tooth, or even choked by a raisin-stone like the poet anacreon, or by a single hair in a draught of milk, like the praetor fabius senator. assuredly only he who always remembers how frail a thing man is will weigh life in an impartial balance!
