next in order come the lees of these several liquids. the lees of wine then are so potent that they are fatal to any who go down into the vats. a lamp let down makes a good test; so long as it goes out danger is indicated. unrinsed lees are an ingredient of medicines; moreover, with au equal weight of iris they make a liniment for phlegmatic eruptions; dry or moist they are applied to the stings of venomous spiders, to inflammation of testicles or breasts, or of any part of the body; or a decoction may be made in wine with barley meal and dust of frankincense. they are dried as well before being parched. the test of their being properly boiled is if, after cooling, a touch, seems to burn the tongue. if kept in an uncovered place wine lees very rapidly lose their power. parching adds greatly to their potency. a decoction with fig is very efficacious for checking lichen and scaly eruptions. in this form they are applied also to leprous sores and running ulcers. taken in drink they are an antidote to poisonous fungi, but a better one when crude. boiled and rinsed they are used as an ingredient of eye salves. an application of them is healing to the testicles and genitals, but in wine they are taken for strangury. when too they have lost their strength, they are still useful for washing the person as well as clothes; for this purpose they take the place of gum arabic.
