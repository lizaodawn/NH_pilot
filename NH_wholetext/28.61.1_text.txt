complaints of the anus are greatly benefited by bear's gall and bear's fat; some add litharge and frankincense. beneficial too is butter with goose grease and rose oil; the quantities are determined by circumstances; the mixture must be easy to apply. greatly beneficial too is bull's gall in scraps of linen; it makes chaps to cicatrize. swellings in that part of the body are reduced by veal suet, especially by that from the groin, with rue; other complaints are cured by goat's blood with pearl barley, condylomata by goat's gall by itself, or by wolf's gall in wine. superficial and other abscesses in any part are dispersed by bear's blood, and likewise by bull's dried and powdered. the finest remedy, however, is said to be the stone which the wild ass is reported to pass in his urine when he is being killed; more fluid than it at first, it grows thick when on the ground. this stone fastened to the thigh as an amulet disperses all inflamed swellings and clears away any suppuration. it is found, however, rarely and not always in the wild ass, but it is wonderfully famous as a remedy. beneficial also is the urine of an ass with melanthium, a horse's hoof reduced to ash and applied with oil and water, the blood of a horse, especially of a stallion, and the blood or gall of an ox or cow. beef too has the same effect if applied hot, the ash of the hoof in water or honey, the urine of she-goats, the flesh too of he-goats boiled down in water or their dung boiled down with honey, a boar's gall, and a pigs' urine applied on wool. it is well known that riding on a horse chafes and galls the inner side of the thighs; most useful for all such troubles is to rub on the groin the foam from the mouth of a horse. the groin also swells because of sores; the remedy is to tie within the sore three horse hairs with three knots.
