the divisions of the seasons are fixed by the fourfold distribution of the year corresponding with the increases and decreases of daylight. from midwinter onward this increases in length, and in 90 days 3 hours at the spring equinox the day becomes equal to the night. from then to the summer solstice, a period of 94 days 12 hours, the day is longer than the night ... until the autumn equinox, and then the night having become equal to the day goes on increasing from that point until midwinter, a period of 88 days 3 hours (in the present passage the term 'hours' in each addition and subtraction denotes equinoctial hours and not the hours of any day in particular) and all these changes occur at the eighth degree of the signs of the zodiac, midwinter at the eighth degree of capricorn, about december 26, the equinox at the eighth of the ram, the summer solstice at the eighth of the crab and the other equinox at the eighth of the scales — which days themselves also usually give some indications of changes of weather. again these periods are also divided by particular moments of time, all of them at midday — since between the solstice and the autumnal equinox the setting of the lyre on the 46th day marks the beginning of autumn, and from that equinox to midwinter the morning setting of the pleiades on the 44th day marks that of winter, and between midwinter and the equinox the prevalence of a west wind on the 45th day marks the period of spring, and the morning rising of the pleiades on the 47th day from the spring equinox marks the beginning of summer. we will start from sowing-time of wheat, that is from the morning setting of the pleiades; and we need not interrupt our explanation and increase the difficulty of the subject by mentioning the minor stars, inasmuch as it is at the same date that the stormy constellation of orion sets after its extensive course.
