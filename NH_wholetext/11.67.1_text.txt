no species except those possessing both windpipe and gullet have a nape; all the others, which have only a gullet, have a neck. but in those possessing a nape it is composed of a number of bones articulated in rings with jointed vertebrae, so as to be capable of bending to look round; only in the lion and wolf and hyena is it a stiff structure of a single straight bone. moreover it is connected with the spine, and the spine with the loins, in a bony but rounded structure, the marrow passing down from the brain through the orifices in the vertebrae. it is inferred that the spinal cord is of the same substance as the brain for the reason that, if its extremely slender membrane is merely cut into, death follows immediately. species with long legs also have long necks; as also have aquatic species even though they have short legs, and similarly if they have hooked claws.
