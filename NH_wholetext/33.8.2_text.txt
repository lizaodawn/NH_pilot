and the thing began to be so common that during the censorship of the emperor claudius a member [ad 48] of the order of knighthood named flavius proculus laid before him information against 400 persons on this ground, so that an order intended to distinguish the holder from other men of free birth has been shared with slaves. it was the gracchi who first instituted the name of justices or judges as the distinguishing name of that order of knights â€” seditiously currying favour with the people in order to humiliate the senate; but subsequently the importance of the title of knight was swamped by the shifting currents of faction, and came down to be attached to the farmers of public revenues, and for some time these revenue officers constituted the third rank in the state. finally marcus cicero, thanks to the catilinarian affair, during his consulship [63 bc] put the title of knighthood on a firm footing, boasting that he himself sprang from that order, and winning its powerful support by methods of securing popularity that were entirely his own. from that time onward the knighthood definitely became a third element in the state, and the name of the equestrian order came to be added to the formula 'the senate and people of rome.' this is the reason why it is even now written after 'people,' because it was the latest addition introduced.
