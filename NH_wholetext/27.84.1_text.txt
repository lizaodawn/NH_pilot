odontitis is classed as a hay with close-set stalks growing from the same root, jointed, triangular and dark. at the joints it has small leaves, longer however than those of polygonum, seed like barley in the axils, and a tiny, bright red flower. it grows in meadows. a decoction of its stalks, a handful in a dry wine, is a cure for toothache, but it must be kept in the mouth.
