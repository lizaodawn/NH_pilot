new, unnamed precious stones come into existence quite unexpectedly, like one which, according to theophrastus, was once found in the gold mines near lampsacus and was sent to king alexander owing to its great beauty. moreover, 'cochlides,' or 'shell stones,' are now very common, but are really artificial rather than natural. in arabia they are found as huge lumps, and these are said to be boiled in honey without interruption for seven days and nights. thus all earthy and other impurities are eliminated; and the lump, cleansed and purified, is divided into various shapes by clever craftsmen, who are careful to follow up the veins and elongated markings in such a way as to ensure the readiest sale. formerly, these lumps were produced in such large sizes that in the east they were made into frontlets for kings' horses aud into pendants to serve as trappings for them. in general, all gems are rendered more colourful by being boiled thoroughly in honey, particularly if it is corsican honey, which is unsuitable for any other purpose owing to its acidity. cunning and talented artists succeed also in cutting away parts of variegated stones so as to obtain novelties; and in order that these selfsame stones may not bear their usual name, they call them 'physis,' or 'works of nature,' and offer them for sale as natural curiosities.
