below the belly in front is the bladder, which occurs in none of the oviparous kinds except the tortoise, in none devoid of lungs filled with blood, and in none without feet. between the bladder and the belly are the tubes called the groin, stretching to the private parts. the bladder of the wolf contains a stone named syrites; but in some human beings there continually form terribly painful stones and bristly fibres. the bladder consists of a membrane that when wounded does not form a solid scar; it is not the same as the one that enfolds the brain or the heart, as there are several kinds of membrane.
