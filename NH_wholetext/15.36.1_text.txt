the actual tree is recorded to have been seen for the first time on the hither side of europe, beginning from the ceraunian mountains, on the grave of elpenor at circello, and it still keeps its greek name, showing it to be an exotic. at the time of the foundation of rome myrtles grew on the present site of the city, as tradition says that the romans and sabines, after having wanted to fight a battle because of the carrying off of the maidens, laid down their arms and purified themselves with sprigs of myrtle, at the place now occupied by the statues of venus cluacina, cluere being the old word meaning 'to cleanse.' and a kind of incense for fumigation is also contained in this tree, which was selected for the purpose on the occasion referred to because venus the guardian spirit of the tree also presides over unions, and i rather think that it was actually the first of all trees to be planted in public places at rome, fraught indeed with a prophetic and remarkable augury. for the shrine of quirinus, that is of romulus himself, is held to be one of the most ancient temples. in it there were two sacred myrtles, which for a long time grew in front of the actual temple, and one of them was called the patricians' myrtle and the other the common people's. for many years the patricians' tree was the more flourishing of the two, and was full of vigour and vitality; as long as the senate flourished this was a great tree, while the common people's myrtle was shrivelled and withered. but after the latter had grown strong while the patrician myrtle began to turn yellow, from the marsian war onward [91-88 bc] the authority of the fathers became weak, and by slow degrees its grandeur withered away into barrenness. moreover there was also an old altar belonging to venus myrtea, whose modern name is murcia.
