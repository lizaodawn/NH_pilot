in addition to all this there are some notable things about the animals that belong to this book: the gromphena, a bird spoken of in sardinia as like a crane, but now, i think, unknown even to the sardinians. in the same province we have the ophion, a creature like deer only in its hair, and found nowhere else. the same authorities say that there is a creature called siralugum, but they have not told us what kind of an animal it is or where it is found. i do not indeed doubt that it once existed, since even medicines from it have been prescribed. marcus cicero tells us that there are animals called biuri which gnaw the vines in campania.
