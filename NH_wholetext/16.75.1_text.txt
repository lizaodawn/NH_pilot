cato, the leading authority on timber in all its uses, adds the following advice: 'make a press of black fir wood for choice. with elm, pine or walnut timber, when you are going to root up these or any other tree, take them up when the moon is waning, in the afternoon, when there is not a south wind. a tree will be ready for felling when its seed is ripe. and be careful not to haul a tree or trim it with the axe when there is a dew.' and the same writer later: 'do not touch timber except at new moon, or else at the end of the moon's second quarter; with timber which you dig up by the roots or cut off level with the ground, the seven days next after full moon are the best for removing it. beware absolutely of rough-hewing or cutting or touching any timber unless it is dry, and when it is frozen or wet with dew. similarly the emperor tiberius kept to the period between two moons even in having his hair cut. marcus varro advises the plan of having one's hair cut just after full moon, as a precaution against going bald.
