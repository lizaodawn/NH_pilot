the turtle has no teeth, but the edges of the beak are sharp on the upper side, and the mouth closing the lower jaw like a box is so hard that they can crush stones. they live on shell-fish in the sea and on plants when they come ashore. they bear eggs like birds' eggs numbering up to 100 at a time; these they bury in the ground somewhere ashore, cover them with earth rammed down and levelled with their chests, and sleep on them at night. they hatch the young in the space of a year. some people think that they cherish their eggs by gazing at them with their eyes; and that the females refuse to couple till the male places a wisp of straw on one as she turns away from him. the cavemen have homed turtles with broad horns twisted inward like those of a lyre but movable, which they use as oars to aid themselves in swimming; the name for this horn is chelium; it is of tortoise shell of exceptional quality, but it is seldom seen, as the very sharp rocks frighten the turtle-eater tribe, while the cavemen, on whose coasts the turtles swim, worship them as sacred. there are also turtles living on land, and consequently called in works on the subject the terrestrial species; these are found in the deserts of africa in the region of the driest and most arid sands, and it is believed that they live on the moisture of dew. no other animal occurs there.
