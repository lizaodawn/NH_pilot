the outstanding merit of citrus-wood tables is to have wavy marks forming a vein or else little spirals. the former marking produces a longish pattern and is consequently called tiger-wood, while the latter gives a twisted pattern and consequently slabs of that sort are called panther-tables. also some have wavy crinkled markings, which are more esteemed if they resemble the eyes in a peacock's tail. besides the kinds previously mentioned, great esteem, though coming after these, belongs to those veined with a thick cluster of what look like grains, these slabs being consequently called parsley-wood, from the resemblance. but the highest value of all resides in the colour of the wood, the colour of meed being the most favoured, shining with the wine that is proper to it. the next point is size: nowadays tables made of whole trunks are admired, or several trunks mortised together in one table.
