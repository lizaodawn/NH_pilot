in ploughing it is extremely important to obey the oracular utterance of cato: 'what is good farming? good ploughing. what is second best? ploughing. what third? manuring.' 'do not plough a crooked furrow. plough in good time.' in comparatively mild places breaking the ground should begin at midwinter, but in colder districts at the spring equinox; and it should begin earlier in a dry region than in a damp one, and earlier in a dense soil than a loose one and in a rich soil than in a poor one. where the summers are dry and oppressive and the land chalky or thin, it pays better to plough between midsummer and the autumnal equinox, but in the middle of the hot weather in places where summer heat is moderate, rainfalls frequent and the soil rich and grassy. it is the rule to stir a deep heavy soil even in the winter, but a very thin and dry one a little before sowing.
