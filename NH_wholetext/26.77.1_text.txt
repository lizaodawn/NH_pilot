a common complaint, affecting any part of the body, but especially an inconvenient part, is what are called boils, sometimes a fatal malady after surgical operations. pounded leaves of pycnocomon with pearl barley are a remedy if the boil has not yet come to a head. boils are also dispersed by applications of leaves of ephedron.
