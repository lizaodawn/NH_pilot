for sorcerers' poisons obtained from the wild weasel a remedy is a copious draught of chicken broth made from an old bird; it is specific for aconite poisoning, and there should be added a dash of salt. hens' dung, provided it is white, boiled down in hyssop or honey wine, is used for poisonous fungi and mushrooms, as well as for flatulence and suffocations — a matter for wonder, because if any animal save man should taste this dung, it will suffer from colic and flatulence. goose blood, with the same quantity of oil, is good for the poison of sea hares, also for all sorcerers' poisons — it is kept with red lemnian earth and the sap of white thorn, and five drachmae of the lozenges should be taken as a dose in three cyathi of water — also a baby weasel prepared as i have described. lamb's rennet too is a powerful antidote to all sorcerers' poisons, as is the blood of pontic ducks; and so when thickened it is also stored away and dissolved in wine. some are of opinion that the blood of a female duck is more efficacious. in like manner general remedies for all poisons are the crop of storks, sheep's rennet, the broth of ram's flesh (which is specific for cantharides), likewise warmed sheep's milk, which is also good for those who have swallowed buprestis or aconite, the dung of wild doves (specific if quicksilver has been swallowed), and for arrow poisons the common weasel, preserved and taken in drink, two drachmae at a time.
