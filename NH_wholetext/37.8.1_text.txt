myrrhine vessels come to us from the east. there the substance is found in several otherwise unremarkable localities, particularly within the kingdom of parthia. it is in carmania, however, that the finest specimens exist. the substance is thought to be a liquid which is solidified underground by heat. in size the pieces are never larger than a small display stand, while in bulk they rarely equal the drinking vessels that we have discussed. they shine, but without intensity; indeed, it would be truer to say that they glisten rather than shine. their value lies in their varied colours: the veins, as they revolve, repeatedly vary from purple to white or a mixture of the two, the purple becoming fiery or the milk-white becoming red as though the new colour were passing through the vein. some people particularly appreciate the edges of a piece, where colours may be reflected such as we observe in the inner part of a rainbow. others prefer thick veins (any trace of transparency or fading is always a fault) and also specks and spots. these spots do not protrude, but are usually flattened, like warts on the body. the smell of the substance is also a merit.
