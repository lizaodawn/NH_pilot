hazelwort also has the property of nard, indeed some people actually call it 'wild nard.' it has the leaves of the ivy, only rounder and softer, a purple flower, the root of gallic nard, and seed like grape-stones, which has a warm taste with a flavour of wine. on shady mountains it flowers twice a year. the best variety grows in pontus, the next best in phrygia and the third in illyricum. when it begins to shed its leaves it is dug up and dried in the sun, as it quickly becomes mouldy and loses its strength. a plant has also lately been found in thrace the leaves of which do not differ at all from the indian nard.
