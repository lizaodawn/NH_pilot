there is still one kind of floor that we must not fail to mention, namely the graecanicum or 'greek style.' the ground is well rammed and rubble or a layer of pounded potsherds laid on it. then charcoal is trodden into a compact mass, and on top of this is spread a mixture of coarse sand, lime and ashes to a thickness of 6 inches. this is carefully finished to rule and level, and has the appearance of earth. but if it is smoothed with a grindstone it will pass for a black stone floor.
