of insects some have two wings, for instance, flies, and some four, for instance bees. the tree-cricket also flies with its membranes. those armed with a sting in the belly have four wings, but none having a weapon in the mouth has more than two wings to fly with, for the former have this weapon bestowed on them for the sake of vengeance but the latter for the purpose of greed. no insects' wings when torn off grow again. none that has a sting in the belly is two-winged.
