few things that supply the apparatus of a more luxurious life rank with this tree, and consequently it seems desirable to dwell on it for a little as well. it was known even to homer - the greek name for it being thyon, otherwise thya. well, homer has recorded its being burut among unguents as one of the luxuries of circe, whom he meant to be understood as a goddess - those who take the word thyon to mean perfumes being greatly in error, especially as in the same verse he says that cedar and larch were burnt at the same time, which shows that he was only speaking of trees. already theophrastus, who wrote immediately after the period of alexander the great, about 314 b.c., assigns a high rank to this tree, stating that it was recorded that the flooring of the old temples used to be made of it and that its timber when used in roofed buildings is virtually everlasting, being proof against all causes of decay; and he says that no wood is more marked with veins than the root, and that no products made of any other material are more valuable. the finest citrus, he says, is round the temple of hammon, but it also grows in the interior of cyrenaica. he makes no mention, however, of tables made of citrus-wood, and indeed there is no older record of one before that of the time of cicero, which proves their novelty.
