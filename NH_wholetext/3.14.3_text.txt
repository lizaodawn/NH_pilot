in this island there are five colonies and sixty-three cities or states. leaving pelorus and facing the ionian sea, we have the town of messana, whose inhabitants are also called mamertini and enjoy the rights of roman citizens; the promontory of drepanum, the colony of tauromenium, formerly called naxos, the river asines, and mount aetna, wondrous for the flames which it emits by night. its crater is twenty stadia in circumference, and from it red-hot cinders are thrown as far as tauromenium and catina, the noise being heard even at maroneum and the gemellian hills. we then come to the three rocks of the cyclopes, the port of ulysses, the colony of catina, and the rivers symaethus and terias; while more inland lie the laestrygonian plains.
