but it is of the first importance to avoid allowing our remedies to produce other defects, which results from using remedial processes to excess or at the wrong time. to prune away branches is beneficial for trees, but to slaughter them every year without respite is extremely unprofitable. a vine only requires a yearly trimming, but myrtles, pomegranates and olives one every other year, because they produce shoots with great rapidity. all other trees should be trimmed less frequently, and none in autumn; and they must not even have their trunks scraped except in spring. pruning must not be assault and battery: every part of the tree that is not actually superfluous is conducive to its vitality.
