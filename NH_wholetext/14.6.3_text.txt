among the remaining wines no kind was particularly famous, but the year of the consulship of lucius opimius, when the tribune gaius gracchus was assassinated for stirring up the common people with seditions, was renowned for the excellence of its vintages of all kinds - the weather was so fine and bright (they call it the 'boiling' of the grape) thanks to the power of the sun, in the 633rd year 121 bc. from the birth of the city; and wines of that year still survive, having kept for nearly 200 years, though they have now been reduced to the consistency of honey with a rough flavour, for such in fact is the nature of wines in their old age; and it would not be possible to drink them neat or to counteract them with water, as their over-ripeness predominates even to the point of bitterness, but with a very small admixture they serve as a seasoning for improving all other wines. assuming that by the valuation of that period their cost may be put at 100 sesterces per amphora, but that the interest on this sum has been adding up at 6 per cent. per annum, which is a legal and moderate rate, we have shown by a famous instance that in the principate of gaius caesar, son of germanicus, 160 [a.d. 39] years after the consulship of opimius, the wine cost that amount for one - twelfth of an amphora - this appears in our biography of the bard pomponius secundus and the banquet that he gave to the emperor mentioned: so large are the sums of money that are kept stored in our wine-cellars! indeed there is nothing else which experiences a greater increase of value up to the twentieth year - or a greater fall in value afterwards, supposing that there is not a rise of price. rarely indeed has it occurred hitherto and only in the case of some spendthrift's extravagance, for wine to fetch a thousand sesterces a cask. it is believed that the people of vienne alone sell their wines flavoured with pitch, the varieties of which we have specified, for a higher price, though out of patriotism they only sell it among themselves; and this wine when drunk cold is believed to be cooler than all the other kinds.
