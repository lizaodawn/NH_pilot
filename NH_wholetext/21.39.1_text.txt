after them come the summer flowers, lychnis, jupiter's flower, a second kind of lily, the iphyon also and the amaracus surnamed phrygian. but the most beautiful to the eye is the pothos. there are two kinds of it: one having the flower of the hyacinth, the other being white and commonly grown for graves, because it lasts well without fading. the iris also blooms in summer. but these too wither and pass away, to be followed again by others in autumn â€” a third kind of lily, the saffron crocus and the two kinds of orsinus, one without and one with perfume, all of them peeping out at the first showers. garland-makers actually use the blossom even of the thorn, while the young stalks of the white thorn are preserved to be a delicacy of the table. this is the succession of flowers overseas. in italy violets are followed by the rose, which is still in blossom when the lily appears. the rose is succeeded by the cyanus, the cyanus by the amaranth. but the vicapervica is an evergreen, surrounded by leaves at the joints after the manner of the scarecrow cord, a plant for the fancy garden, but at times filling the gap when other flowers fail. this plant is called chamaedaphne by the greeks.
