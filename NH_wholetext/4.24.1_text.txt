the hellespont. - the lake maeotis. the fourth great gulf of europe begins at the hellespont and ends at the entrance of the maeotis. but in order that the several portions of the euxine and its coasts may be the better known, we must briefly embrace the form of it in one general view. this vast sea, lying in front of asia, is shut out from europe by the projection of the shores of the chersonesus, and effects an entrance into those countries by a narrow channel only, of the width, as already mentioned, of seven stadia, thus separating europe from asia. the entrance of these straits is called the hellespont; over it xerxes, the king of the persians, constructed a bridge of boats, across which he led his army. a narrow channel extends thence a distance of eighty-six miles, as far as priapus, a city of asia, at which alexander the great passed over. at this point the sea becomes wider, and after some distance again takes the form of a narrow strait. the wider part is known as the propontis, the straits as the thracian bosporus, being only half-amile in width, at the place where darius, the father of xerxes, led his troops across by a bridge. the extremity of this is distant from the hellespont 239 miles.
