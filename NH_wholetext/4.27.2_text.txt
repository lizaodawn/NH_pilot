the hellespont has no islands belonging to europe that are worthy of mention. in the euxine there are, at a distance of a mile and a half from the european shore, and of fourteen from the mouth of the strait, the two cyanaean islands, by some called the symplegades, and stated in fabulous story to have run the one against the other; the reason being the circumstance that they are separated by so short an interval, that while to those who enter the euxine opposite to them they appear to be two distinct islands, but if viewed in a somewhat oblique direction they have the appearance of becoming gradually united into one. on this side of the ister there is the single island of the apolloniates, eighty miles from the thracian bosporus; it was from this place that m. lucullus brought the capitoline apollo. those islands which are to be found between the mouths of the ister we have already mentioned. before the borysthenes is achillea previously referred to, known also by the names of leuce and macaron. researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles from the borysthenes, of 120 from tyra, and of fifty from the island of peuce. it is about ten miles in circumference. the remaining islands in the gulf of carcinites are cephalonnesos, rhosphodusa, and macra. before we leave the euxine, we must not omit to notice the opinion expressed by many writers that all the interior seas take their rise in this one as the principal source, and not at the straits of gades. the reason they give for this supposition is not an improbable one - the fact that the tide is always running out of the euxine and that there is never any ebb.
