the fourth kind of tithymallus is called helioscopios. it has the leaves of purslane, and four or five small branches standing out from the root, which are reddish, half a foot high and full of juice. this kind grows around towns, and has a white seed of which pigeons are very fond. the name helioscopios has been given to this plant because it moves its heads round to follow the sun. bile it carries away by urine or stool when taken in doses of half an acetabulum in oxymel. its other uses are the same as those of characias.
