night-owls wage a crafty battle against other birds. when surrounded by a crowd that outnumbers them they lie on their backs and defend themselves with their feet, and bunching themselves up close are entirely protected by their beak and claws. through a kind of natural alliance the hawk comes to their aid and takes part in the war. nigidius relates that night-owls hibernate for 60 days every winter, and that they have nine cries.
