the genus shell-fish also includes the fan-mussel. it occurs in marshy places, always in an upright position, and never without a companion which is called the pea-crab, or by others the sea-pen-protector: this is a small shrimp, elsewhere called a crab, its attendant at the feast. the sea-pen opens, presenting the dark inside of its body to the tiny fishes; these at once dart forward, and when their courage has grown by license, they fill up the sea-pen. her marker having watched for this moment gives her a signal with a gentle nip. she by shutting up kills whatever she has enclosed, and bestows a share on her partner.
