finally in the ninth year in office of the emperor tiberius the order of knights was united [ad. 14-37] into a single body; and in the consulship of gaius [ad. 22]. asinius pollio and gaius antistius vetus, in the 775th year since the foundation of rome, a regulation was established authorizing who should wear rings; the motive for this, a thing that may surprise us, was virtually the futile reason that gaius sulpicius galba had made a youthful effort to curry favour with the emperor by enacting penalties for keeping eating-houses and had made a complaint in the senate that peddling tradesmen when charged with that offence commonly protected themselves by means of their rings. consequently a rule was made that nobody should have this right except one who was himself a free-born man whose father and father's father had been free-born also, and who had been rated as the owner of 400,000 sesterces and had been entitled under the julian law as to the theatre to sit in the fourteen front rows of seats. subsequently people began to apply in crowds for this mark of rank; and in consequence of the disputes thus occasioned the emperor gaius caligula added [ad. 37-41] a fifth panel, and so much conceit has this occasioned that the panels which under his late lamented majesty augustus it had not been possible cases of men who are actually liberated slaves making to fill will not hold that order, and there are frequent a leap over to these distinctions, a thing that previously never occurred, since the iron ring was the distinguishing mark even of knights and judges.
