the lily [devil's garter] comes nearest to the rose in fame, and there is a certain relationship shown in the ointment and oil, which they call lilinum (oil of lilies). when blended with roses, also, the lily gives a grand combination, making its first appearance when the rose is in mid-season. no flower grows taller; sometimes it reaches three cubits, its neck always drooping under the weight of a head too heavy for it. the flower is of an exceeding whiteness, fluted on the outside, narrow at the bottom and gradually expanding in width after the fashion of a basket. the lips curve outwards and upwards all round; the slender pistil and stamens, the colour of saffron, standing upright in the centre, so the perfume of the lily, as well as its colour, is twofold, there being one for the corolla, and another for the stamens, the difference being slight. in fact when it is nsed to make ointment or oil the petals too are not despised. there is a flower not unlike the lily growing on the plant called the convolvulus, that springs up among shrubs. without perfume and without the yellow anthers in the centre, it resembles the lily only in colour, being as it were a first attempt by nature when she was learning to produce lilies. white lilies are propagated by all the means that roses are; more than this, by a peculiar tear-like gum of its own, as is also horse-parsley. no plant is more prolific, a single root often sending out fifty bulbs. there is also a red lily that the greeks call crinon, some calling its blossom the dog-rose. the most esteemed kind grows at antioch and at laodicea in syria, next to them comes that of phaselis. the fourth place is held by the kind growing in italy.
