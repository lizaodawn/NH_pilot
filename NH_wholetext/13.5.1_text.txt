i could not readily say when the use of unguents first made its way to rome. it is certain that in 189 bc the censors publius licinius crassus and lucius julius caesar issued a proclamation forbidding any sale of 'foreign essences' — that being the regular name for them. but, good heavens! nowadays some people actually put scent in their drinks, and it is worth the bitter flavour for their body to enjoy the lavish scent both inside and outside. it is a well-known fact that lucius plotius, the brother of lucius plancus who was twice consul and censor, when proscribed by the triumvirs was given away in his hiding-place at salerno by the scent of the unguent he had been using — a disgrace that acquitted the entire proscription of guilt, for who would not consider that people of that sort deserved to die?
