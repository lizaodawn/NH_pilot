wasps make their nests high up, of mud, and in them make cells of wax; hornets make them in caverns or underground; all of these have hexagonal cells, and make their combs of bark, like spiders' webs. the actual offspring are not uniform but vary - one flies out while another is in the pupa and another in the grub; and all of these stages are in the autumn, not the spring. they grow chiefly at full moon. the wasps called ichneumon-flies - they are smaller than the others - kill one kind of spider called phalangium and carry them to their nests and then smear them over, and from these by incubating produce their own species. moreover they all feed on flesh, contrary to bees which never touch a body. but wasps hunt larger flies and after cutting off their heads carry away the rest of the body.
