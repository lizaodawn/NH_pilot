the slag of copper is also washed in the same way, but it is less efficacious than copper itself. the flower of copper also is useful as a medicine. it is made by fusing copper and then transferring it to other furnaces, where a faster use of the bellows makes the metal give off layers like scales of millet, which are called the flower. also when the sheets of copper are cooled off in water they shed off other scales of copper of a similar red hue — this scale is called by the greek word meaning husk and by this process the flower is adulterated, so that the scale is sold as a substitute for it — the genuine flower is a scale of copper forcibly knocked off with bolts into which are welded cakes of the metal, specially in the factories of cyprus. the whole difference is that the scale is detached from the cakes by successive hammerings, whereas the flower falls off of its own accord. this another finer kind of scale, the one knocked off from the down-like surface of the metal, the name for which is 'stomoma.'
