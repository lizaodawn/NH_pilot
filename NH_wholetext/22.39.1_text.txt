iasine (bindweed?) too is considered to be a wild vegetable. it creeps on the ground, is full of milky juice, and bears a white flower called conchylium. this plant too has the same merit of exciting to sexual intercourse. eaten raw in vinegar with food it brings also a rich supply of milk to nursing mothers. it is health-giving to those suffering from consumption. applied to the head of babies it makes the hair grow, and the scalp more retentive of it.
