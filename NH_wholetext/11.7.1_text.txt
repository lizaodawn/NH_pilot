besides these things a collection is made of which some people call sandarach and others bee-bread; this will serve as food for the bees while they are at work, and it is often found stored up in the hollows of the combs, being itself also of a bitter flavour, but it is produced out of spring dew of trees like the gums. it is obtained in fig trees — blacker in colour when an east wind is blowing and of better quality and a reddish colour when north winds blow — and in the largest quantity in greek nut-trees. menecrates says that it is a flower, but he is the only authority that makes that statement.
