the people of delos began the practice of fattening hens, which has given rise to the pestilential fashion of gorging fat poultry basted with its own gravy. i find this first singled out in the old interdicts dealing with feasts as early as the law of the consul gaius fannius eleven years before the third punic war, prohibiting the serving of any bird course beside a single hen that had not been fattened â€” a provision that was subsequently renewed and went on through all our sumptuary legislation. and a way round so as to evade them was discovered, that of feeding male chickens also with foodstuffs soaked in milk, a method that makes them esteemed as much more acceptable. as for hens, they are not all chosen for fattening, and not unless they have fat skin on the neck. subsequently came elaborate methods of dressing fowls, so as to display the haunches, so as to split them along the back, so as to make them fill the dishes by spreading them out from one foot. even the parthians bestowed their fashions on our cooks. and nevertheless with all this showing off, no entire dish finds favour, only the haunch or in other cases the breast being esteemed.
