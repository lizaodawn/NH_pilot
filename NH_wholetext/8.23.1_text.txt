the panther and the tiger almost alone of beasts are distinguished by a variety of markings, whereas the rest have a single colour, each kind having its own â€” black in the case of lions in syria only. panthers have small spots like eyes on a light ground. it is said that all four-footed animals are wonderfully attracted by their smell, but frightened by the savage appearance of their head; for which they catch them by hiding their head and enticing them to approach by their other attractions. some authorities report that they have a mark on the shoulder resembling a moon, expanding into a circle and hollowed out in a similar manner. as it is, people use the name 'spotted ladies', and for the males 'pards', in the whole of this genus, which occurs most frequently in africa and syria; some persons distinguish panthers from these by their light colour only, nor have i hitherto discovered any other difference.
