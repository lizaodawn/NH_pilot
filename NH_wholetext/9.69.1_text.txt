we are informed that there are three kinds of sponge: a thick and very hard and rough one is called goat-thorn sponge, a less thick and softer one loose-sponge, and a thin one of close texture, used for making paintbrushes, achilles sponge. they all grow on rocks, and feed on shells, fish and mud. these creatures manifestly possess intelligence, because when they are aware of a sponge-gatherer they contract and make it much more difficult to detach them. they do the same when much beaten by the waves. the tiny shells found inside them clearly show that they live by eating food. it is said that in the neighbourhood of torone they can be fed on these shell-fish even after they have been pulled off the rocks, and that fresh sponges grow again on the rocks from the roots left there; also the colour of blood remains on them, especially on the african ones that grow on the sandbanks. very large but very soft thin sponges grow round lycia, though those in deep and calm water are softer; the rough kind grows in the dardanelles, and the close-textured round cape malea. sponges decay in sunny places, and consequently the best are found in deep pools. live sponges have the same blackish colour as sponges in use have when wet. they do not cling to the rock with a particular part nor with their entire surface, for they have certain empty tubes, about four or five in number, running through them, through which it is believed that they take their food. they also have other tubes, but these are closed at the upper end; and it is understood that there is a sort of thin skin on the under side of their roots. it is established that they live a long time. the worst of all the species of sponge is one called in greek the dirty sponge, because it cannot be cleaned; it contains large tubes, and the rest of it is of a very close texture.
