of the aizoum there are two kinds, the larger of which is planted in earthen pots, and is sometimes called buphthalmos, zoophthalmos, tergethron (because it is useful for love-philtres), hypogeson (for it generally grows under eaves), although some prefer to call it ambrosia or amerimon; italians call it great sedum, or eye, or little finger. the other kind is rather small, and is called erithales, trithales (because it flowers three times), erysithales, isoetes, sedum by italians, and both are called aizoum, because they are always green, or sempervivum. the greater aizoum grows to even more than a cubit in height and is thicker than a thumb. at the point the leaves are like a tongue, fleshy, rich with copious juice, as broad as a thumb, some bent to the ground and others upright, so that the circle of them is like an eye in shape. the smaller aizoum grows on walls, ruins, and roof-tiles; it is bushy from the root and leafy to the top, with narrow, pointed and juicy leaves, and a stem a span high. the root is not used.
