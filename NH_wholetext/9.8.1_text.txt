the dolphin is an animal that is not only friendly to mankind but is also a lover of music, and it can he charmed by singing in harmony, but particularly by the sound of the water-organ. it is not afraid of a human being as something strange to it, but comes to meet vessels at sea and sports and gambols round them, actually trying to race them and passing them even when under full sail. in the reign of the late lamented augustus a dolphin that had been brought into the lucrine lake fell marvellously in love with a certain boy, a poor man's son, who used to go from the baiae district to school at pozzuoli, because fairly often the lad when loitering about the place at noon called him to him by the name of snub-nose and coaxed him with bits of the bread he had with him for the journey, — i should be ashamed to tell the story were it not that it has been written about by maecenas and fabianus and flavius alfius and many others, — and when the boy called to it at whatever time of day, although it was concealed in hiding used to fly to him out of the depth, eat out of his band, and let him mount on its back, sheathing as it were the prickles of its fin, and used to carry him when mounted right across the bay to pozzuoli to school, bringing him back in similar manner, for several years, until the boy died of disease, and then it used to keep coming sorrowfully and like a mourner to the customary place, and itself also expired, quite undoubtedly from longing. another dolphin in recent years at hippo diarrhytus on the coast of africa similarly used to feed out of people's hands and allow itself to be stroked, and play with swimmers and carry them on its back. the governor of africa, flavianus, smeared it all over with perfume, and the novelty of the scent apparently put it to sleep: it floated lifelessly about, holding aloof from human intercourse for some months as if it had been driven away by the insult; but afterwards it returned and was an object of wonder as before. the expense caused to their hosts by persons of official position who came to see it forced the people of hippo to destroy it. before these occurrences a similar story is told about a boy in the city of iasus, with whom a dolphin was observed for a long time to be in love, and while eagerly following him to the shore when he was going away it grounded on the sand and expired; alexander the great made the boy head of the priesthood of poseidon at babylon, interpreting the dolphin's affection as a sign of the deity's favour. hegesidemus writes that in the same city of iasus another boy also, named hermias, while riding across the sea in the same manner lost his life in the waves of a sudden storm, but was brought back to the shore, and the dolphin confessing itself the cause of his death did not return out to sea and expired on dry land. theophrastus records that exactly the same thing occurred at naupactus too. indeed there are unlimited instances: the people of amphilochus and taranto tell the same stories about boys and dolphins; and these make it credible that also the skilled harpist arion, when at sea the sailors were getting ready to kill him with the intention of stealing the money he had made, succeeded in coaxing them to let him first play a tune on his harp, and the music attracted a school of dolphins, whereupon he dived into the sea and was taken up by one of them and carried ashore at taenarum
