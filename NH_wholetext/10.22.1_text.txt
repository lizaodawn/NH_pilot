now let us speak about the second class, which is divided into two kinds, songbirds and plumage-birds. the former kind are distinguished by their song and the latter by their size; so the latter shall come first in order also, and among them before all the rest will come the peacock class, both because of its beauty and because of its consciousness of and pride in it. when praised it spreads out its jewelled colours directly facing the sun, because in that way they gleam more brilliantly; and at the same time by curving its tail like a shell it contrives as it were reflexions of shadow for the rest of its colours, which actually shine more brightly in the dark, and it draws together into a cluster all the eyes of its feathers, as it delights in having them looked at. moreover when it moults its tail feathers every year with the fall of the leaves, it seeks in shame and sorrow for a place of concealment until others are born again with the spring flowers. it lives for 25 years, but it begins to shed its colours at the age of three. the authorities relate that this creature is not only ostentatious but also spiteful, just as the goose is said to be modest â€” since some writers have added these characteristics also in that species, though i do not accept them.
