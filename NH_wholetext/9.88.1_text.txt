there are also remarkable facts as to their quarrels and their friendship. violent animosity rages between the mullet and the wolf-fish, and between the conger and the lamprey, which gnaw each other's tails. the langouste is so terrified of the polyp that it dies if it merely sees one near to it, and so does the conger if it sees a langouste; while on the other hand congers tear a polyp to pieces. nigidius states that the wolf-fish gnaws at the tail of the mullet, although they are friendly together in certain months, but that all the mullets with their tails amputated in this way continue to live. but on the other hand instances of friendship, in addition to the creatures whose alliance we have mentioned, are the whale and the sea-mouse: because the whale's eyes are overburdened with the excessively heavy weight of its brows the sea-mouse swims in front of it and points out the shallows dangerous to its bulky size, so acting as a substitute for eyes. there will follow an account of the natures of birds.
