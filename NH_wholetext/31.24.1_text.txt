the first prize for the coolest and most wholesome water in the whole world has been awarded by the voice of rome to the aqua marcia, one of the gods' gifts to our city. this was once called the aqua aufeia, and the source itself aqua pitonia. it rises at the extreme end of the paelignian range, crosses the country of the marsi and the fucine lake, plainly making straight for rome. next it sinks into the underground caves near tibur, reappearing and completing its journey of nine more miles along an aqueduct. the first to begin the bringing of this water to rome was one of the kings, ancus marcius; later, repairs were carried out by quintus marcius rex in his praetorship, and again by marcus agrippa.
