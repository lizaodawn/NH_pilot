the nile first enters the egyptian territory at syene, on the frontiers of aethiopia; that is the name of a peninsula a mile in circumference, upon which castra is situate, on the side of arabia. opposite to it are the four islands of philae, at a distance of 600 miles from the place where the nile divides into two channels; at which spot, as we have already stated, the delta, as it is called, begins. this, at least, is the distance, according to artemidorus, who also informs us that there were in it 250 towns; juba says, however, that the distance between these places is 400 miles. aristocreon says that the distance from elephantis to the sea is 750 miles; elephantis being an inhabited island four miles below the last cataract, sixteen beyond syene, 585 from alexandria, and the extreme limit of the navigation of egypt. to such an extent as this have the above-named authors been mistaken! this island is the place of rendezvous for the vessels of the aethiopians: they are made to fold up, and the people carry them on their shoulders whenever they come to the cataracts.
