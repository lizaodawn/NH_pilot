cabbages and kales which now have pre-eminence in gardens, i do not find to have been held in honour among the greeks; but cato sings marvellous praises of the head of cabbage, which we shall repeat when we deal with medicine. he classifies cabbages as follows â€” a kind with the leaves wide open and a large stalk, another with a crinkly leaf, which is called celery-cabbage, and a third with, very small stalks; the last is a smooth and tender cabbage, and he puts it lowest in value. cabbage is sown all the year round, since it is also cut all the year round, but it pays best to sow it at the autumnal equinox; and it is transplanted when it has made five leaves. in the next spring after its first sowing it yields sprout-cabbage; this is a sort of small sprout from the actual cabbage stalks, of a more delicate and tender quality, though it was despised by the fastidious taste of apicius and owing to him by drusus caesar, not without reproof from his father tiberius. after the sprout-cabbage from the same stalk we get summer and autumn sprouts, and then winter ones, and a second crop of sprout-cabbage, as no kind of plant is equally productive, until it gets exhausted by its own fertility. the second sowing begins at. the spring equinox, and the seedling is bedded out at the end of spring, so that it may not bear in the sprout-cabbage stage before making cabbage-head; the third is about midsummer, and the produce of this is bedded out during the summer if the place is rather damp and in autumn if it is drier. it has a more agreeable taste if it has not had much moisture or manure, but makes a more abundant growth if they have been plentiful. ass's dung makes the most suitable manure for it.
