l. siccius dentatus was presented with this crown but once, although he earned fourteen civic crowns and fought out one hundred and twenty battles, victorious in all. so much rarer a thing is it for a decoration to be conferred by rescued men upon the one man who rescued them. certain commanders have even been decorated more than once, p. decius mus, for instance, when military tribune, once by his own army, and again by those who formed the relieved garrison. he showed by a devout act how great a dignity this distinction brought with it, seeing that after the presentation he sacrificed to mars a white bull, as well as the hundred tawny ones which at the same time had been given to him by the relieved garrison in recognition of his courage. this decius afterwards when consul with emperiosus as his colleague sacrificed himself as a victim in order to secure victory. it was also given by the senate and people of rome — the highest distinction in my opinion that a human being can attain to — to that fabius who 'restored the whole roman state' by refusing to fight, not however on the occasion when he rescued the master of the horse and his army; it was then thought preferable for a crown and a new title, 'father,' to be given him by those whom he had rescued. the unanimous vote i spoke of gave him the honour when hannibal was driven from italy, and the crown was the only one placed on the recipient's head by the hand of the state itself, and — a special feature in the case of fabius — it was the only one given by the whole of italy.
