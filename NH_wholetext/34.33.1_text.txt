the substances called by greek names meaning 'bubble' and 'ash' are also found in the furnaces of copper works. the difference between them is that bubble is disengaged by washing but ash is not washed out. some people have given the name of 'bubble' to the substance that is white and very light in weight, and have said that it is the ashes of copper and cadmea, but that ash is darker and heavier, being scraped off the walls of furnaces, mixed with sparks from the ore and sometimes also with charcoal. this material when vinegar is applied to it gives off a smell of copper, and if touched with the tongue has a horrible taste. it is a suitable ingredient for eye medicines, remedying all troubles whatever, and for all the purposes for which 'ash' is used; its only difference is that its action is less violent. it is also used as an ingredient for plasters employed to produce a gentle cooling and drying effect. it is more efficacious for all purposes when it is moistened with wine.
