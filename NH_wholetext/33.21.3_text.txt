gold dug up from shafts is called 'channelled' or 'trenched' gold; it is found sticking to the grit of marble, not in the way in which it gleams in the lapis lazuli of the east and the stone of thebes and in other precious stones, but sparkling in the folds of the marble. these channels of veins wander to and fro along the sides of the shafts, which gives the gold its name; and the earth is held up by wooden props. the substance dug out is crushed, washed, fired and pound to a soft powder. the powder from the mortar is called the 'scudes' and the silver that comes out from the furnace the 'sweat'; the dirt thrown out of the smelting-furnace in the case of every metal is called 'scoria,' slag. in the case of gold the scoria is pounded and fired a second time; the crucibles for this are made of tasconium, which is a white earth resembling clay. no other earth can stand the blast of air, the fire, or the intensely hot material.
