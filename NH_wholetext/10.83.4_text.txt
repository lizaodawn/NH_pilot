there are several kinds of dogs. the spartan hounds breed when both sexes are seven months old; the bitches carry for 60 days, and 63 at most. the bitches of the other breeds are willing to couple, even when six months old. they all conceive from a single coupling. those that are bred from before the proper time have puppies that stay blind longer, and all of them for the same number of days. they are believed to raise the leg in making water when about six months old; this is a sign of fully matured strength. bitches relieve themselves sitting. the most prolific have litters of twelve, but usually they have five or six, and sometimes only one: this is considered portentous, as are litters that are all males or all females. male puppies are born first in each litter, whereas in all other animals the sexes come in turns. bitches couple five months after their last litter. the spartan hounds have litters of eight. the males of that breed are marked by keenness for work. spartan dog hounds live ten years, bitches twelve; all the other breeds live fifteen years, some times even twenty. but they do not breed all their lives, ceasing usually at the age of twelve.
