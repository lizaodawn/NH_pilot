lathyris has many leaves like those of lettuce, but slighter, and many buds, in which the seed is enclosed in envelopes as is that of the caper. when the buds are dry, the seeds, of the size of a peppercorn, are taken out; they are white, sweet, and easily shelled. twenty of them in fresh water or hydromel cure dropsy, and also draw away bile. those who wish for a more violent purge take the pods themselves with the seeds, but since they injure the stomach the plan has been devised of taking them with fish or chicken broth.
