there is an animal belonging to the same season that always lives with its head fixed in the blood of a host, and consequently goes on swelling, as it is the only animal that has no vent for its food; with gorging to excess it bursts, so dying of its very nutriment. this creature never grows in carthorses but occurs frequently in oxen and occasionally in dogs in which all creatures breed, whereas this alone occurs in sheep and goats. equally remarkable is the thirst for blood that is even felt by leeches in marshy water; for they too penetrate with the whole of their head. dogs have a special pest of their own, a maggot that lances particularly, their ears, which they cannot protect by their bite.
