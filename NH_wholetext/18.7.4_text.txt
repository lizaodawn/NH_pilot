the next point requiring attention is the efficiency of bailiffs, and cato has given many instructions with regard to these. let it be enough for us to say that the bailiff ought to be as near as possible to his master in intelligence, and nevertheless not think so himself. farming done by slave-gangs hired from houses of correction is utterly bad, as is everything else done by desperate men. it may appear rash to quote one dictum of the old writers, and perhaps it may be judged impossible to credit unless its value is closely examined — it is that nothing pays less than really good farming. lucius tarius rufus, who, though of extremely humble birth, by his soldierly efficiency won a consulship, though in other respects a man of old-fashioned economy, spent the whole of the money he had accumulated through the generosity of his late majesty augustus, about 100 million sesterces, in buying up farms in picenum and farming them with the purpose of making a name for himself, so that his heir refused to take over the estate. is it our opinion then that this policy means ruin and starvation? nay rather, i vow, it is that moderation is the most valuable criterion of all things. good farming is essential, but superlatively good farming spells ruin, except when the farmer runs the farm with his own family or with persons whom he is in any case bound to maintain. there are some crops which it does not pay the landlord to harvest if the cost of the labour is reckoned, and olives are not easily made to pay; and some lands do not repay very careful farming — this is said to be the case in sicily, and consequently newcomers there find themselves deceived.
