of cheese from the provinces the most highly praised at rome, where the good things of all nations are estimated at first hand, is that of the district of nemausus, coming from the villages of lesura and gabalicum; but it only wins approval for a short time and when fresh. the alps prove the value of their pastures by two kinds of cheese: the dalmatian mountains send the docleate and the ceutronic the vatusic. a larger number belong to the apennines: these send cebanum cheese from liguria, chiefly made of sheep's milk, sarsina cheese from umbria, and luniensis cheese from the borderland of etruria and liguria â€” this cheese is remarkable for its size, in fact it is actually made up to the weight of 1000 pounds the cheese; but nearest to rome is the vestinian, and the kind from the caedician plain is the most approved. herds of goats also have their special reputation for cheese, in the case of fresh cheese especially when smoke increases its flavour, as with the supremely desirable cheese made in the city itself; for the cheese of the gallic goats always has a strong medicinal taste. but of cheeses from over seas the bithynian is quite famous. that pastures contain salt, even where it is not visible, is chiefly detected from the fact that all cheese as it gets old turns saltish, just as cheeses steeped in vinegar and thyme undoubtedly return to their original fresh flavour. it is recorded that zoroaster in the desert lived for twenty years on cheese that had been so treated as not to be affected by age.
