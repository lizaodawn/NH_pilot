myosota or myosotis is a smooth plant with several stems growing from one root, these being red to a certain extent and hollow; narrow leaves grow at the bottom, longish, with a spine along the back, dark, carefully arranged in pairs at regular intervals. there are slender stalks growing from the axils, and the blossom is blue. the root, of the thickness of a finger, is fringed with many filaments like hairs. it has septic and ulcerating properties, and so heals lacrimal fistulas. the egyptians say that if, on the twenty-eighth day of the month they call thoth (a day generally falling in our august), you rub yourself over in the morning with the juice of this plant before speaking to anyone, you will not in that year a suffer from ophthahnia.
