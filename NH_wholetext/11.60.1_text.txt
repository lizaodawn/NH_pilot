the viviparous species have lips - whence the surnames lippy and blubber-lips - and a well-shaped or rather harsh mouth. instead of ups birds have pointed beaks of horn, which are hooked in birds of prey, straight in those that live by pecking, and broad in those that dig up grass and mud, like the snouts of the swine class. cattle use their mouths instead of a hand for gathering fodder. beasts that live by tearing up their prey have mouths that open wider.
