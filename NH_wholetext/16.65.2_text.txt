every kind of reed makes a great many stems from one root, and when it is cut down it grows again even more prolifically. the root is by nature very tenacious of life; it as well as the stem is jointed. only the indian bamboo has short leaves, but in all the reeds the leaves sprout from a knot and wrap the stem all round with coats of thin tissue, and at a point halfway between two knots usually cease to clothe the stems and droop forward. the reed and the cane though round have two sides, with a series of shoots thrown out above the knots alternately, so that one forms on the right side and then another at the next joint above on the left, turn and turn about. from these sometimes grow branches, which are themselves slender canes.
