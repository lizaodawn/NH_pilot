but of all the parts common to animals gall by far the most efficacious. its nature is warming, pungent, dissolvent, extractive, and dispersive. that of the smaller animals is understood to be more delicate, and so is thought to be more useful for eye medicaments. bull's gall is particularly potent, staining even bronze and basins with a golden colour. all gall is prepared when fresh by tying with stout thread the mouth of the gall bladder, steeping it for half an hour in boiling water, then drying it out of the sun, and storing away in honey. that of horses alone is condemned as a poison. therefore the sacrificial flamen is not allowed to touch a horse, although at the public sacrifices at rome a horse is even offered as a victim.
