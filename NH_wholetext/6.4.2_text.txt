at the back of the mountains of this district is iberia, while on the coast are the heniochi, the ampreutae, the lazi, the rivers acampsis, isis, mogrus, and bathys, the nations of the colchi, the town of matium, the river heracleum and the promontory of the same name, and the phasis, the most celebrated river of pontus. this river rises among the moschi, and is navigable for the largest vessels a distance of thirty-eight miles and a half, and for small ones very much higher up; it is crossed by one hundred and twenty bridges. it formerly had many cities of note on its banks, the more famous of which were tyndaris, circaion, cygnus, and phasis at its mouth. but the most celebrated of them all was aea, fifteen miles distant from the sea, where the hippos and the cyaneos, rivers of vast size, flow into it from opposite directions. at the present day its only place of note is surium, which derives its name from the river which flows at that spot into the phasis, and up to which place the phasis is navigable for large vessels, as we have already mentioned. it receives also some other rivers, wonderful for their number and magnitude, and among them the glaucus. at the mouth of the phasis, at a distance of seventy miles from absarus, are some islands, which, however, have no name. after passing this, we come to another river, the charieis, and the nation of the salae, by the ancients called phthirophagi, as also suani. the river chobus flows from the caucasus through the country of the suani. the river rhoas comes next, then the region of ecrectice, the rivers singames, tarsuras, astelephus, chrysorrhoas, the nation of the absilae, the castle of sebastopolis, one hundred miles distant from phasis, the nation of the sannigae, the town of cygnus, and the river and town of penius. we then come to the tribes of the heniochi, who are distinguished by numerous names.
