pausias's son and pupil aristolaus was one of the painters of the very severe style; to him belong an epaminondas, a pericles, a medea, a virtue, a theseus, a figure representing the athenian people, and a sacrifice of oxen. some persons also admire nicophanes, who was likewise a pupil of pausias, for his careful accuracy which only artists can appreciate, though apart from that he is hard in his colouring and lavish in his use of ochre. as for socrates he is justly a universal favourite; popular pictures by him are his group of asclepius with his daughters health, brightness, all-heal and remedy, and his sluggard, bearing the greek name of ocnos, laziness, and represented as twisting a rope of broom which an ass is nibbling.
