as to the 'balanites,' or 'acorn-stone,' there are two varieties, of which one is greenish and the other like corinthian bronze in its colour. the former comes from coptos and the latter from the cave-dweller country, and both are intersected through the middle by a bright red layer. the 'batrachites,' or 'frog-stone,' also comes from coptos: one variety has a colour like that of a frog, a second is similar and also has veins, while a third is red mixed with black. the 'baptes,' or 'dipper,' has an exceptionally pleasant scent, but is otherwise an ordinary soft stone. the 'eye of baal' has a whitish ground surrounding a dark eye which sends out a golden gleam from its midst. because of its appearance, the stone is consecrated to the holiest god of the assyrians. there is another 'baal stone,' as it is called, which, according to democritus, is found at arbela and is as large as a walnut, with a glassy appearance. 'baroptenus,' also known as 'baripe,' is a black stone with blood-red and white nodules.
