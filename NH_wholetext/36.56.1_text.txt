as for columns, identical ones appear to increase in thickness merely by being placed more closely together. there are four kinds of columns. columns the height of which is six times their lower diameter are the so-called doric. those in which the height is nine times the lower diameter are the ionic; and those in which it is seven times the tuscan. corinthian columns have the same proportions as the ionic except that the height of the corinthian capitals equals the lower diameter, so that they appear to be more slender than the ionic, where the height of the capital is a third of the lower diameter. in ancient times a proportion observed was that the breadth of a temple should be three times the height of the columns. it was in the earlier temple of diana at ephesus that columns were for the first time mounted on moulded bases and crowned with capitals, and it was decided that the lower diameter of the columns should be one-eighth of their height, that the height of the moulded bases should be one-half of the lower diameter and that the lower diameter should exceed the upper diameter by a seventh. another kind of column is that known as the attic, which is quadrangular and equilateral.
