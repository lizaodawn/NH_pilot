sheep are also of great service either in respect of propitiatory offerings to the gods or in the use of their fleeces. as oxen improve men's diet, so the protection of their bodies is owed to sheep. they breed when two years old on both sides, till the age of nine, and in some cases even till ten. the lambs at the first birth are smaller. they all couple from the setting of arcturus, that is may 13th, to the setting of aquila, july 23rd; they carry their lambs 150 days. lambs conceived after the date mentioned are weak; in old days those born later were called cordi. many people prefer winter lambs to spring ones, holding that it is more important for them to be well-established before midsummer than before midwinter, and that this animal alone is advantageously born in winter. it is inbred in the ram to despise lambs as mates and to desire maturity in sheep; and the ram himself is better in old age, and also more serviceable when polled. his wildness is restrained by boring a hole in the horn close to the ear. if a ligature is put on the right testicle he gets females and if on the left males. claps of thunder cause sheep to miscarry when solitary; the remedy is to herd them in flocks, so as to be cheered by company. they say that male lambs are got when a north wind is blowing and female when a south; and in this breed the greatest attention is given to the mouths of the rams, as the wool in the case of the progeny is of the colour of the veins under the tongue of the parent ram, and if these were of several colours the lamb is van-coloured. also changing the water they drink varies their colour.
