holosteon (all-bone) is a plant with nothing hard about it, the name being an antiphrasis coined by the greeks, just as they call gall sweet. its root is so slender as to look like hair. four fingers long, the plant has narrow leaves like grass and an astringent taste, growing on hills with deep soil. taken in wine for sprains and ruptures it also closes wounds, for it even fastens together pieces of meat when boiled with them.
