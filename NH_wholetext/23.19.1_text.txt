the varieties of wine, their very many differences, and most of the properties of each i have already described. there is no topic more difficult to handle, or more full of detail, seeing that it is hard to say whether wine does good to more people or harms them. besides, a draught is fraught with great risk, it being uncertain whether it will immediately turn out to be a help or a poison. and indeed i shall confine my present remarks to the properties of wine as a medicine. asclepiades composed one volume on its administration, a circumstance which gave him a nickname but his commentators on it afterwards composed an endless number of them. i, with roman seriousness and with my appetite for the liberal arts, will carefully discuss the separate details, not as a physician, but to point out their effect on human health. but to treat of the various kinds of wine one by one is a vast and baffling task, because medical opinion is very divided.
