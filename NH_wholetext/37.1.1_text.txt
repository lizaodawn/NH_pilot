in order that the work that i have undertaken may be complete, it remains for me to discuss gemstones. here nature's grandeur is gathered together within the narrowest limits; and in no domain of hers evokes more wonder in the minds of many who set such store by the variety, the colours, the texture and the elegance of gems that they think it a crime to tamper with certain kinds by engraving them as signets, although this is the prime reason for their use; while some they consider to be beyond price and to deft evaluation in terms of human wealth. hence very many people find that a single gemstone alone is enough to provide them with a supreme and perfect aesthetic experience of the wonders of nature.
