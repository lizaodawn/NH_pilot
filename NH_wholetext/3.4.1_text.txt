of nearer spain: the ancient form of the nearer spain, like that of many other provinces, is somewhat changed, since the time when pompey the great, upon the trophies he erected in the pyrenees, testified that 877 towns, from the alps to the borders of the farther spain, had been reduced to subjection by him. the whole province is now divided into seven jurisdictions, those of carthage, of tarraco, of caesar augusta, of clunia, of asturica, of lucus, and of the bracari. to these are to be added the islands, which will be described on another occasion, as also 293 states which are dependent on others; besides which the province contains 179 towns. of these, twelve are colonies, thirteen, towns with the rights of roman citizens, eighteen with the old latian rights, one confederate, and 135 tributary.
