it is well for the apiaries to look due east, and to avoid the north wind as well as the west wind. the best hive is made of bark; the next best material is fennel-giant, and the third is osier. many too have made hives of transparent stone, so that they might look on the bees working inside. it is very useful for the hives to be daubed all over with cow dung, and for a movable cover to be made at the back, that it may be brought forward if the hive be large or the working unproductive, lest the bees lose hope and cease to care; this cover should be gradually slid back so that they do not see how their work has grown. in winter cover the hives with straw, and fumigate them repeatedly, especially with cow dung. this being akin to the bees kills the insects that breed in the hive â€” spiders, moths and wood worms, besides stimulating the bees themselves. to exterminate the spiders indeed is fairly easy. the moths, a greater plague, are destroyed in the spring by lamps, which are lighted before the hives when the mallow begins to ripen, on a night of the new moon when the sky is clear. into the flame of these the moths fling themselves.
