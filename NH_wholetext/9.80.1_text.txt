in the same period the elder licinius murena invented fishponds for all the other sorts of fish, and his example was subsequently followed by the celebrated record of philip and hortensius. lucullus had built a channel that cost more than a country house, by actually cutting through a mountain near naples and letting in the sea; this was why pompey the great used to call him 'xerxes in roman dress.' after his decease the fish from this pond sold for 4,000,000 sesterces.
