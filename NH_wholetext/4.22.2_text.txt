next to this island is rhene, which anticlides calls by the name of celadussa, and callidemus, artemite; scyros, which the old writers have stated to be twenty miles in circumference, but mucianus 160; oliaros; and paros, with a city of the same name, distant from delos thirty-eight miles, and famous for its marble; it was first called platea, and after that, minois. at a distance of seven miles from this last island is naxos, with a town of the same name; it is eighteen miles distant from delos. naxos was formerly called strongyle, then dia, and then dionysias, in consequence of the fruitfulness of its vineyards; others again have called it the lesser sicily, or callipolis. it is seventy-five miles in circumference â€” half as large again as paros.
