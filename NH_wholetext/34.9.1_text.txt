but after a time this art in all places came to be usually devoted to statues of gods. i find that the first image of a god made of bronze at rome was that dedicated to ceres and paid for out of the property of spurius cassius who was put to death [485 bc] by his own father when trying to make himself king. the practice passed over from the gods to statues and representations of human beings also, in various forms. in early days people used to stain statues with bitumen, which makes it the more remarkable that they afterwards became fond of covering them with gold. this was perhaps a roman invention, but it certainly has a name of no long standing at rome. it was not customary to make effigies of human beings unless they deserved lasting commemoration for some distinguished reason, in the first case victory in the sacred contests and particularly those at olympia, where it was the custom to dedicate statues of all who had won a competition; these statues, in the case of those who had been victorious there three times, were modelled as exact personal likenesses of the winners â€” what are called iconicae, portrait statues. i rather believe that the first portrait statues officially erected at athens were those of the tyrannicides harmodius and aristogeiton. this happened in the same year [510 bc] as that in which the kings were also driven out at rome. the practice of erecting statues from a most civilized sense of rivalry was afterwards taken up by the whole of the world, and the custom proceeded to arise of having statues adorning the public places of all municipal towns and of perpetuating the memory of human beings and of inscribing lists of honours on the bases to be read for all time, so that such records should not be read on their tombs only. soon after a publicity centre was established even in private houses and in our own halls: the respect felt by clients inaugurated this method of doing honour to their patrons.
