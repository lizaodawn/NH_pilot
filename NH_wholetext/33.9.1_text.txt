indeed the very name of the knights has itself frequently been altered, even in the case of those who derived the title from the fact of their serving as cavalry. under romulus and the kings they were called the celeres, then the flexuntes and afterwards the trossuli, because of their having without any assistance from infantry captured a town of that name in etruria nine miles this side of volsinii; and the name survived till after the time of gaius gracehus. at all events in the writings left by junius, who owing to his friendship with gaius gracchus was called gracehanus, these words occur: 'so far as concerns the equestrian order they were previously called the trossuli, but are now simply designated the cavalry, because people do not know what the word trossuli means and many of them are ashamed of being called by that name.' he goes on to explain the reason above indicated, and says that they were even in his time still called trossuli, though they did not wish to be.
