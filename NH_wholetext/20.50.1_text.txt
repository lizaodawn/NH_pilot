on the other hand cress is antaphrodisiac, but as we have already said sharpens the senses. there are two varieties of it. the white acts as a purge, and carries bile away if one denarius by weight of it be taken in seven of water. it is an excellent cure for scrofula if applied with bean meal and covered with a cabbage leaf. the other kind, which is darker, purges away peccant humours of the head, clears the vision, calms if taken in vinegar troubled minds, and benefits the spleen when drunk in wine or eaten with a fig, or a cough if taken in honey, provided that the dose be repeated daily and administered on an empty stomach. the seed in wine expels all parasites of the intestines, more effectively however if there be added wild mint. taken with wild marjoram and sweet wine it is good for asthma and cough, and a decoction in goat's milk relieves pains in the chest. applied with pitch it disperses superficial abscesses; applied in vinegar it extracts thorns from the body and removes spots. when used for carcinoma white of egg is added. it is applied in vinegar to the spleen, but with babies it is best applied in honey. sextius adds that burnt cress keeps away serpents, and neutralizes scorpion stings; that the pounded plant relieves headache, and mange, if mustard be added; that pounded and placed with fig on the ears it relieves hardness of hearing, and tooth ache if its juice be poured into the ears; and that dandruff and sores on the head are removed if the juice be applied with goose grease. boils it brings to a head if applied with leaven. it makes carbuncles suppurate and break, and with honey it cleanses phagedaenic ulcers. with pearl barley it is applied in vinegar for sciatica and lumbago, likewise for lichen and rough nails, because its nature is caustic. the best kind, however, is the babylonian; the wild variety for all the purposes mentioned is the more efficacious.
