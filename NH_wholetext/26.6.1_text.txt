this itself is a wonderful fact, that some diseases should disappear from among us while others remain endemic, as for example colum. it was in the principate of tiberius caesar that this malady made its way into italy. nobody suffered from it before the emperor himself, and the citizens were greatly puzzled when they read in his edict, in which he begged to be excused because of illness, a name they had never heard before. what are we to say that this means, what wrath of the gods? were the recognised kinds of human disease, more than three hundred, too few, that they must be increased by new ones also to add to man's fears? no fewer either are the troubles which man brings upon himself by his own agency. these remedies that i record were those used by the ancients, nature in a way making medicine herself, and their vogue was a long one. certainly the works of hippocrates, who was the first to put together, and that with great distinction, rules for medical practice, we find full of references to herbs, equally so the works of diocles of carystus, who comes next after hippocrates in time and reputation, likewise those of praxagoras and chrysippus, and then comes erasistratus of ceos; while herophilus indeed, although the founder of an over-subtle sect, we know recommended before all others this method of treatment. but little by little experience, the most efficient teacher of all things, and in particular of medicine, degenerated into words and mere talk. for it was more pleasant to sit in a lecture-room engaged in listening, than to go out into the wilds and search for the various plants at their proper season of the year.
