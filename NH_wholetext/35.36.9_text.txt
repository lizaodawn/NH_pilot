a clever incident took place between protogenes and apelles. protogenes lived at rhodes, and apelles made the voyage there from a desire to make himself acquainted with protogenes's works, as that artist was hitherto only known to him by reputation. he went at once to his studio. the artist was not there but there was a panel of considerable size on the easel prepared for painting, which was in the charge of a single old woman. in answer to his enquiry, she told him that protogenes was not at home, and asked who it was she should report as having wished to see him. 'say it was this person,' said apelles, and taking up a brush he painted in colour across the panel an extremely fine line; and when protogenes returned the old woman showed him what had taken place. the story goes that the artist, after looking closely at the finish of this, said that the new arrival was apelles, as so perfect a piece of work tallied with nobody else; and he himself, using another colour, drew a still finer line exactly on the top of the first one, and leaving the room told the attendant to show it to the visitor if he returned and add that this was the person he was in search; and so it happened; for apelles came back, and, ashamed to be beaten, cut a the lines with another in a third colour, leaving no room for any further display of minute work. hereupon protogenes admitted he was defeated, and flew down to the harbour to look for the visitor; and he decided that the panel should be handed on to posterity as it was, to be admired as a marvel by everybody, but particularly by artists. i am informed that it was burnt in the first fire which occurred in caesar's palace on the palatine; it had been previously much admired by us, on its vast surface containing nothing else than the almost invisible lines, so that among the outstanding works of many artists it looked like a blank space, and by that very fact attracted attention and was more esteemed than every masterpiece there.
