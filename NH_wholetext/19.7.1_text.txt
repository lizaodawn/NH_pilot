as a matter of fact the employment of esparto began many generations later, and not before the first invasion of spain by the carthaginians. esparto also is a plant, which is self-sown and cannot be grown from seed; strictly it is a rush, belonging to a dry soil, and all the blame for it attaches to the earth, for it is a curse of the land, and nothing else can be brown or can spring up there. in africa it makes a small growth and is of no use. in the cartagena section of hither spain, and not the whole of this but as far as this plant grows, even the mountains are covered with esparto grass. country people there use it for bedding, for fuel and torches, for footwear and for shepherd's clothes; but it is unwholesome fodder for animals, except the tender growth at the tops. for other purposes it is pulled out of the ground, a laborious task for which gaiters are worn on the legs and the hands are wrapped in woven gauntlets, and levers of bone or holm-oak are used; nowadays the work goes on nearly into winter, but it is done most easily between the middle of may and the middle of june, which is the season when the plant ripens.
