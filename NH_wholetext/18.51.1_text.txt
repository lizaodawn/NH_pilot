there is a city-state of africa called tacape, in the middle of the desert on the route to the syrtes and great leptis, which has the exceptionally marvellous blessing of a well-watered soil. there is a spring that distributes water over a space of about three miles in every direction, giving a generous supply, but nevertheless it is distributed among the population only at special fixed periods of the day.
