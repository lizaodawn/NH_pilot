in creatures possessing a stomach the abdomen is below it; it is single in the other species but double in the ruminants. species without blood have no stomach, because in some, for instance the cuttlefish and the polyp, the intestine beginning at the month bends back to the same point. in man the abdomen is connected with the bottom of the stomach, like the dog's. these are the only animals in which it is narrower at the lower part, and consequently they are the only ones that vomit, because when the abdomen is full this narrowness prevents the food from passing, which cannot happen to those in which the roomy laxity of the abdomen passes the food on to the lower parts.
