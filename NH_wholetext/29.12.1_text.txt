there is, moreover, a kind of egg which is very famous in the gauls, but not mentioned by the greeks. snakes intertwined in great numbers in a studied embrace make these round objects with the saliva from their jaws and the foam from their bodies. it is called a 'wind egg.' the druids say that it is tossed aloft by the snakes' hisses, and that it ought to be caught in a military cloak before it can touch the earth. the catcher, they say, must flee on horseback, for the serpents chase him until they are separated by some intervening river. a test of a genuine egg is that it floats against the current, even if it is set in gold. such is the clever cunning of the magi in wrapping up their frauds that they give out as their opinion that it must be caught at a fixed period of the moon, as if agreement between snakes and moon for this act depended upon the will of man. i indeed have seen this egg, which was like a round apple of medium size, and remarkable for its hard covering pitted with many gristly cup-hollows, as it were, like those on the tentacles of an octopus. the druids praise it. highly as the giver of victory in the law-courts and of easy access to potentates. herein they are guilty of such lying fraud that a roman knight of the vocontii, for keeping one in his bosom during a lawsuit, was executed by the late emperor claudius, and for no other reason. however, this embrace and fertile union of snakes seem to be the reason why foreign nations, when discussing peace terms, have made the herald's staff surrounded with figures of snakes; and it is not the custom for the snakes on a herald's staff to have a crest.
