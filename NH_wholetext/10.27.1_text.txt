our countrymen are wiser, who know the goose by the excellence of its liver. stuffing the bird with food makes the liver grow to a great size, and also when it has been removed it is made larger by being soaked in milk sweetened with honey. not without reason is it a matter of enquiry who was the discoverer of so great a boon â€” was it scipio metellus the consular, or his contemporary marcus seius, knight of rome? but it is an accepted fact that messalinus cotta, son of the orator messala, invented the recipe for taking from geese the soles of the feet and grilling them and pickling them in dishes with the combs of domestic cocks; for i will award the palm scrupulously to each man's culinary achievement. a remarkable feat in the case of this bird is its coming on foot all the way to rome from the morini in gaul: the geese that get tired are advanced to the front rank, and so all the rest drive them on by instinctively pressing forward in their rear.
