there are two primary kinds of ivy, as of the rest of the plants, the male and the female. the male is said to have the larger stem and leaf, which also are harder and have more sap, and so it also has a larger flower, approaching purple in colour; but the flower of both male and female resembles the wild rose, except that it has no scent. these kinds each comprise three species, for ivy is white or black and a third species is called helix. moreover these species divide into others, since one kind only has white fruit but another has a white leaf as well; also in some of those bearing white fruit the berry is closely packed and rather large, hanging in round bunches which are called 'clusters,' and also silenici when the berry is smaller and the bunch less compact — as similarly occurs in the black variety. also one kind has a black seed and another a seed of the colour of saffron; the latter ivy is used by poets for their wreaths, and its leaves are not so dark in colour; some people call it nysian ivy and others bacchic ivy, and it has the largest clusters of all the black ivies. some people among the greeks also make two classes of this variety, depending on the colour of the berries — red-berry ivy and golden-fruit ivy.
