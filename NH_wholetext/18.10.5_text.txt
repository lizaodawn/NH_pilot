beans shoot out into leaves and then throw out a stalk which is divided by no joints. the rest of the leguminous plants are tough and woody. some of them are branching - the chick-pea, the bitter vetch and the lentil. in some the stems spread along the ground if they are not propped up, but peas climb if given a prop, or else they deteriorate. the bean is the only one of the leguminous plants that has a single stem; the lupine also has only one but it does not stand up straight, all the others having branches with a very thin woody stalk, but all of them hollow. some send out a leaf from the root, some from the top, for instance wheat and barley. each of these and all the plants that make straw have one leaf at the top - though barley leaves are rough and those of the rest smooth - whereas the bean, the chick-pea and the pea are many-leaved. in corn the leaf is like that of a reed; those of the bean and a large part of the leguminous plants are round; those of the fitch and the pea rather long, that of calavance veined, that of sesame and winter cress the colour of blood. only the lapin and the poppy shed their leaves. leguminous plants remain longer in flower, and among them more particularly the fitch and the chick-pea, but longest of all the bean, which flowers for forty days, though the single stalks do not keep their flowers so long, since when one goes off another begins, nor does the whole crop flower at the same time, as with corn, but all the pods form on different days, the blossom starting first at the bottom and rising gradually.
