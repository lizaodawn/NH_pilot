stars also come into existence at sea on land. i have seen a radiance of star-like appearance clinging to the javelins of soldiers on sentry duty at night in front of the rampart; and on a voyage stars alight on the yards and other parts of the ship, with a sound resembling a voice, hopping from perch to perch in the manner of birds. these when they come singly are disastrously heavy and wreck ships, and if they fall into the hold burn them up. if there are two of them, they denote safety and portend a successful voyage; and their approach is said to put to flight the terrible star called helena: for this reason they are called castor and pollux, and people pray to them as gods for aid at sea. they also shine round men's heads at evening time; this is a great portent. all these things admit of no certain explanation; they are hidden away in the grandeur of nature.
