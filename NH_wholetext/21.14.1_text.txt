next in esteem comes the violet, of which there are several kinds, the purple, the yellow, the white, all of them planted as are vegetables, from cuttings. of these kinds however the purple, which comes up wild in sunny, poor soils, springs up with a broader, fleshy leaf, coming straight from the root. it is the only one to be distinguished from the others by a greek name, being called ion, from which ianthine cloth gets its name. of the cultivated violets, the most highly esteemed is the yellow variety. the kinds called tusculan and marine have a slightly broader but less perfumed petals. the calatian variety however is entirely without perfume and has a very small petal; it is a gift of autumn, but all other kinds bloom in spring.
