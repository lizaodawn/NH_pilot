pounded acorns with salted axle-grease cure the indurations that are called malignant. more potent are those of the holm-oak, and in all acorns the more potent parts are the peel itself and the skin just under it. a decoction of the latter is good for coeliac affections. in cases of dysentery also even the acorn itself is applied. the same decoction is a remedy for snake bites, fluxes and suppurations. the leaves and berries, or the bark, or the liquid of a decoction, counteract poisons. a decoction of the bark in cows' milk is applied to snake bites, and the bark in wine is given for dysentery. the holm-oak has the same properties.
