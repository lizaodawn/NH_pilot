the laurel is the only tree the name of which is used in latin as a man's name, and the only tree whose leaves have a special name applied to them â€” we call them bay-leaves. the name of the tree also survives as a place-name in rome, as there is a locality on the aventine called loretto where there was once a laurel grove. moreover, the laurel is employed in rituals of purification; and incidentally it should be stated that it can even be grown from a slip, as this has been doubted by democritus and theophrastus. we will now describe the various forest trees.
