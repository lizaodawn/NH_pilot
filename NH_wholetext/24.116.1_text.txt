philanthropos is a name which the greeks in witty sarcasm give to a plant because it sticks to the clothes. a chaplet made out of it and placed on the head relieves headaches. but what is called dog-bur, if beaten up in wine with plantain and millefolium, heals cancerous sores, the plaster being taken off every third day. it also cures pigs, if dug up without iron; it is added to their swill before they go to feed, or else given them in milk and wine. some add that as he is getting it up the digger should say: 'this is the plant argemon, which minerva discovered to be a remedy for the pigs that shall taste of it.'
