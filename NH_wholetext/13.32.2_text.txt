this is the nature of the lotus-tree in africa. but the same name also belongs to a herbaceous plant, as well as to a colewort in egypt belonging to the class of marsh-plants. this springs up when the flood waters of the nile retire; it resembles a bean in its stalk and in its leaves, which grow in large, thick clusters, although they are shorter and more slender than the leaves of a bean. the fruit grows in the head of the plant and resembles the fruit of the poppy in its indentations and in every other way; it contains grains like millet-seeds. the natives pile these heads in heaps to rot, and then separate the seeds by washing and dry them and crush them, and use them to make bread. there is a further remarkable fact reported, that when the sun sets these poppies shut up and fold their leaves round them, and at sunrise open again, this going on till they ripen and the flower, which is white, falls off. a further point reported is that in the euphrates both the head itself and the flower at the evening go on submerging till midnight, and disappear entirely into the depth so that they cannot be found even by plunging the hand in, and then return and by degrees straighten up again, and at sunrise come out of the water and open their flower, and still go on rising so that the flower is raised up quite a long way above the water. the lotus has a root of the size of a quince, enclosed in a black skin like the shell of a chestnut; inside it has a white body, agreeable to eat raw but still more agreeable when boiled in water or roasted in the ashes. its peelings are more useful than any other fodder for fattening pigs.
