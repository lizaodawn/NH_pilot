snakes and lizards have long internal organs. there is a record that when a person at volaterrae named caecina was performing a sacrifice, some snakes darted out from the internal organs of the victim - a joyful portent; and indeed it would seem nothing incredible to those considering that on the day on which king pyrrhus died the heads of his victims when cut off crawled about licking up their own blood. in man the chief internal organs are separated from the lower part of the viscera by a membrane which is called the praecordia (diaphragm), because it is stretched prae (in front of) the cor (heart): the greek word for it is phrenes. indeed provident nature has enclosed all the principal internal organs with special membranes serving as sheaths; but in the case of this membrane a special cause also was the proximity of the bowels, to prevent the food from pressing down on the vital principle. to this membrane unquestionably is due the subtlety of the intellect; it consequently has no flesh, but is of a spare sinewy substance. in it also is the chief seat of merriment, a fact that is gathered chiefly from tickling the armpits to which it rises, as nowhere else is the human skin thinner, and consequently the pleasure of scratching is closest there. on this account there have been cases in battle and in gladiatorial shows of death caused by piercing the diaphragm that has been accompanied by laughter.
