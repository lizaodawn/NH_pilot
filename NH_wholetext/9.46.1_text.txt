there are many sorts of polyp. the land kinds are larger than the marine. they use all their arms as feet and hands, but employ the tail, which is forked and pointed, in sexual intercourse. the polyps have a tube in their back through which they pass the seawater, and they shift this now to the right side and now to the left. they swim with their head on one side, this while they are alive being hard as though blown out. otherwise they remain adhering with a kind of suction, by means of a sort of suckers spread over their arms: throwing themselves backward they hold on so that they cannot be torn away. they do not cling to the bottom of the sea, and have less holding-power when full-grown. they alone of the soft creatures go out of the water on to dry land, provided it has a rough surface: they hate smooth surfaces. they feed on the flesh of shellfish, the shells of which they break by enfolding them with their tentacles; and consequently their lair can be detected by the shells lying in front of it. and though the polyp is in other respects deemed a stupid animal, inasmuch as it swims towards a man's hand, it has a certain kind of sense in its domestic economy: it collects everything into its home, and then after it has eaten the flesh puts out the refuse and catches the little fishes that swim up to it. it changes its colour to match its environment, and particularly when it is frightened. the notion that it gnaws its own arms is a mistake, for this is done to it by the congers; but the belief that its tails grow again, as is the case with the gecko and the lizard, is correct.
