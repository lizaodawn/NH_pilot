in cardiac disease the one hope of relief lies undoubtedly in wine. some however think that it should be given only during an attack, others only when there is a remission; the object of the former is to control the sweating, the latter think that there is increased safety when the disease is on the decline, most authorities, i notice, holding this view. it ought at any rate to be given only with food, not after sleep nor after another kind of drink — that is, there must at any rate be thirst — only in the last resort and to a man rather than a woman, to an old man rather than to a young one, to a young man rather than to a boy, in winter rather than in summer, to those used to wine rather than to teetotallers. the dose to be taken depends upon the potency of the wine and also on the amount of water added. the general opinion is that a satisfactory mixture is one cyathus of wine to two of water. if the stomach be disordered, should the food not pass down, the wine must be given once more.
