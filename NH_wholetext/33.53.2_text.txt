gaius gracchus had some figures of dolphins for which he paid 5000 sesterces per pound, while the orator lucius crassus had a pair of chased goblets, [140-91 bc] the work of the artist mentor, that cost 100,000; yet admittedly he was too ashamed ever to use them. it is known to us that he likewise owned some vessels that he bought for 6000 sesterces per pound. it was the conquest of asia that first introduced luxury into italy, inasmuch as lucius scipio carried in procession at his triumph 1400 lbs. of chased silverware and vessels of gold weighing 1500 lbs: this was in the 565th year from the foundation of the city of rome. but receiving asia also as a gift [189 bc] dealt a much more serious blow to our morals, and the bequest of it that came to us on the death of king attalus was more disadvantageous than the victory of scipio. for on that occasion all scruples entirely disappeared in regard to buying these articles at the auctions of the king's effects at rome — the date was the 622nd year of the city, and in the interval of 57 years our community had learnt not merely to admire but also to covet foreign opulence; an impetus having also been given to manners by the enormous shock of the conquest of achaia, that victory itself also having during this interval of time introduced the statues and pictures won in the 608th year of the city. that nothing might be lacking, luxury came into being simultaneously, with the downfall of carthage, a fatal coincidence that gave us at one and the same time a taste for the vices and an opportunity for indulging in them. some of the older generation also sought to gain esteem from these sources. it is recorded that gaius marius after his victory over the cimbrians drank from bacchic tankards, in imitation of father liber — he, the ploughman of arpino who rose to the position of general from the ranks!
