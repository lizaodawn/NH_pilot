moreover we know that clothes are dyed with a wonderful dye from a plant, and, to say nothing of the fact that, of the berries of galatia, africa, and lusitania, the 'coccum' is specially served to colour the military cloaks of our generals, transalpine gaul can produce with vegetable dyes tyrian purple, oyster purple and all other colours. to get these nobody seeks the murex oyster in the depths, offering his person as bait to sea monsters while he hastens to snatch his booty, and exploring a bottom that no anchor yet has touched, merely to discover the means for a matron to charm her paramour more easily and for a seducer to ensnare another's wife. there one stands on land to harvest dyes as we harvest crops; and though there is a complaint that the dye washes out with use, except for this defect luxury could have bedecked itself in brighter colours, and certainly with less risk to life. it is not my intention now to treat this subject fully, but i shall not pass it over entirely, so that i may, by suggesting cheaper materials, curb luxury by expediency, and on another occasion i shall tell how walls are dyed instead of being painted in mosaics. yet i should not have left out the craft of dyeing altogether, had it ever been included among the liberal arts. in the meantime i shall take a bolder line, and there shall be assigned even to dull, that is to say, lowly plants all the dignity that is their due, since it is a fact that the founders and enlargers of the roman empire derived from this source also an immense advantage, because it was from them that came the tufts used when the state needed cures, and also the vervains required in holy ceremonies and in embassies. at any rate both names mean the same thing, that is, a turf from the citadel pulled up with its own earth; and on every occasion when envoys were sent to the enemy to perform clarigatio, that is to demand in loud tones the restitution of plundered property, one in particular was called vervain bearer.
