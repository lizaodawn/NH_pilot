the topic seems of itself to call for the view held by astronomical science. epigenes declared that it is impossible to live 112 years; berosus said that 116 years can be exceeded. also the theory handed down by petosiris and necepsos is still extant (it is called the theory of quarters, from its dividing up the zodiac into groups of three signs); this theory shows it possible to attain 124 years of life in the region of italy. these thinkers declared that nobody exceeds the ascendant measure of 90 degrees (what is called 'risings'), and stated that this period itself may be cut short by the encounter of maleficent stars, or even by their rays and by those of the sun. again it is uncertain what is the greatest longevity allowed by the school of aesculapius, which says that fixed periods of life are received from the stars; however, they say that longer periods of life are rare, inasmuch as vast crowds of men are born at critical moments in the hours of the lunar days, for example the 7th and the 15th hour counting by night and day, who are liable to die under the law of the ascending scale of years, called 'gradations', persons so born rarely exceeding their fifty-fourth year.
