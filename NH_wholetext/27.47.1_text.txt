dipsacos has leaves like those of lettuce, with prickly knobs on the middle of their backs. the stem, two cubits long and rough with the same prickles, has joints enfolded by pairs of leaves, forming hollow axils in which collects a salt, dewy fluid. on the top of the stem are little heads, which bristle with prickles. the plant grows on watery ground. a decoction of the root in wine heals chaps of the anus; fistulas as well, but the decoction must be reduced to the consistency of wax, so that a suppository may be inserted into the fistula. it also removes warts of all kinds, for which purpose some apply the juice that is found in the axils which i mentioned above.
