the principal woods for cutting into layers and for using as a veneer to cover other kinds of wood are citrus, turpentine-tree, varieties of maple, box, palm, holly, holm-oak, the root of the elder, and poplar. also the alder, as has been stated, supplies a tuberosity that can be cut into layers, as do the citrus and the maple; no other trees have tuberosities so much valued. the middle part of trees is more variegated, and the nearer the root the smaller and the more wavy are the markings. this first originated the luxury use of trees, covering up one with another and making an outside skin for a cheaper wood out of a more expensive one. in order that one tree might be sold several times over, even thin layers of wood have been invented. and this was not enough: the horns of animals began to be dyed and their tusks cut in slices, and wood to be inlaid and later veneered with ivory. next came the fancy of ransacking even the sea for material: tortoise-shell was cut up to provide it, and recently, in the principate of nero, it was discovered by miraculous devices how to cause it to lose its natural appearance by means of paints and fetch a higher price by imitating wood. a little time ago luxury had not thought wood good enough, but now it actually manufactures wood out of tortoiseshell. by these methods high prices are sought for couches and orders are given to outdo turpentine wood, make a more costly citrus, and counterfeit maple.
