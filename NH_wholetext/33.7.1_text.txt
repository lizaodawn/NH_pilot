as soon as rings began to be commonly worn, they distinguished the second order from the commons, just as a tunic distinguished the senate from those who wore the ring, although this distinction also was only introduced at a late date, and we find that a wider purple stripe on the tunic was commonly worn even by heralds, for instance the father of lucius aelius stilo praeconinus, who received his surname from his father's office. but wearing rings clearly introduced a third order, intermediate between the commons and the senate, and the title that had previously been conferred by the possession of a war-horse is now assigned by money rates. this however is only a recent introduction: when his late lamented majesty augustus made regulations for the judicial panels the majority of the judges belonged to the iron ring class, and these used to be designated not knights but justices; the title of knights remained with the cavalry squadrons mounted at the public charge. of the justices also there were at the first only four panels, and in each panel scarcely a thousand names were to be found, as the provinces had not yet been admitted to this duty; and the regulation has survived to the present day that nobody newly admitted to citizenship shall serve as a justice on one of the panels. the panels themselves also were distinguished by various designations, as consisting of tribunes of the money, selected members and justices. moreover beside these there were those styled the nine hundred, selected from the whole body as keepers of the ballot-boxes at elections. and the proud adoption of titles had made divisions in this order also, one person styling himself a member of the nine hundred, another one of the select, another a tribune.
