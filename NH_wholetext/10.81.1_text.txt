the only viviparous creature that flies is the bat, which actually has membranes like wings; it is also the only flyer that nourishes its young with milk, bringing them to its teats. it bears twins, and flits about with its children in its arms, carrying them with it. the bat is mid to have a single hipbone. gnats are its favourite fodder.
