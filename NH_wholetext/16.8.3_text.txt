the best and largest acorn grows on the common oak, and the next best on the winter oak, as that of the hard-oak is small, and that of the turkey oak a rough, bristly thing with a prickly cup like that of the chestnut. but also in the case of the oak in general the acorn of the female tree is sweeter and softer, while that of the male tree is more compact. in the most esteemed variety called descriptively the broad-leaved oak, the acorns differ among themselves in size and in the thinness of their shell, and also in that some have under the shell a rough coat of a rusty colour, whereas in others one comes to the white flesh at once. those acorns are also esteemed the kernel of which at each extremity taken lengthwise has a stony hardness, those having this in the husk being better than those with it in the flesh of the nut, but in either case it only occurs with a male tree. moreover in some cases the acorn is oval, in others round, and in others of a more pointed shape, just as the colour also is blacker or lighter, the latter being preferred. the ends of acorns are bitter and the middle parts sweet; also there is a difference in the shortness or length of the stalk.
