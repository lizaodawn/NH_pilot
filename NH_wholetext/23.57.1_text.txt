it would be waste of time to go over again the nine varieties of pomegranates. the sweet ones, which i have also called apyrena, are considered to be injurious to the stomach; they cause flatulence, and do harm to the teeth and gums. those however which resemble these closely in taste, called by me vinous pomegranates, have small pips and are understood to be a little more useful. they are astringent to the bowels and stomach, provided that moderation is observed and surfeit avoided. in fever even these are strictly forbidden, although no pomegranates at all ought really to be allowed, as neither pulp of the seeds nor the juice is anything but injurious. they are equally to be avoided when there is vomiting and bringing up of bile. in these nature has shown us a grape and, not mere must, but actually wine ready made. both are enclosed in a rather rough skin, which in the case of the bitter fruit is much used. it is popular knowledge that skins are thoroughly tanned by it; hence physicians call it the leather apple. they tell us that it is diuretic, and that a decoction in vinegar with the addition of gall-nut strengthens loose teeth. it is in request for easing the nausea of women with child, since by a taste the foetus is quickened. the apple is divided and soaked in rain water for about three days. this infusion is drunk cold by sufferers from coeliac affections and spitting of blood.
