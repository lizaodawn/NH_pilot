some people during the process of smelting mix lead-filings with the sulphur, and others use lead acetate in preference to sulphur. another use of lead is to make a wash — it is employed in medicine — pieces of lead with rainwater added being ground against themselves in leaden mortars till the whole assumes a thick consistency, and then water floating on the top is removed with sponges and the very thick sediment left when dry is divided into tablets. some people grind up lead filings in this way and some also mix in some lead ore; but others use vinegar, others wine, others grease, others oil of roses. some prefer to grind the lead with a stone pestle in a stone mortar, and especially one made of thebes stone, and this process produces a drug of a whiter colour. calcined lead is washed like antimony and cadmea. it has the property of acting as an astringent and arresting haemorrhage and of promoting cicatrisation. it is of the same utility also in medicines for the eyes, especially as preventing their procidence, and for the cavities or excrescences left by ulcers and for fissures of the anus or haemorrhoids and swellings of the anus. for these purposes lead lotion is extremely efficient, while for creeping or foul ulcers ash of calcined lead is useful; and the benefit they produce is on the same lines as in the case of sheets of papyrus. the lead is burnt in small sheets mixed with sulphur, in shallow vessels, being stirred with iron rods or fennel stalks till the molten metal is reduced to ashes; then after being cooled off it is ground into powder. another process is to boil lead filings in a vessel of raw earth in furnaces till the earthenware is completely baked. some mix with it an equal amount of lead acetate or of barley and grind this mixture, in the way stated in the case of raw lead, and prefer the lead treated in this way to the cyprus slag.
