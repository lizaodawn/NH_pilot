what are called sprinkling powders are made of dried scents, the dregs of unguents being termed 'magma.' among all the scents employed the one added last is the most powerful. unguents keep best in alabaster boxes, scents when mixed with oil, and the fatter it is, as for instance oil of almonds, the better it helps to preserve them for a long time; and the unguents themselves improve with age. sunshine is detrimental to them, and therefore they are stored in the shade, in vessels made of lead. when being tested they are put on the back of the hand, to avoid their being damaged by the warmth of the fleshy part.
