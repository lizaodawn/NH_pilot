moreover also the parts of some constellations have an influence of their own - for instance at the autumnal equinox and at midwinter, when we learn by the storms that the sun is completing its orbit; and not only by falls of rain and storms, but by many things that happen to our bodies and to the fields. some men are paralysed by a star, others suffer periodic disturbances of the stomach or sinews or bead or mind. the olive and white poplar and willow turn round their leaves at the solstice. fleabane hung up in the house to dry flowers exactly on midwinter day, and inflated skins burst. this may surprise one who does not notice in daily experience that one plant, called heliotrope, always looks towards the sun as it passes and at every hour of the day turns with it, even when it is obscured by a cloud. indeed persistent research has discovered that the influence of the moon causes the shells of oysters, cockles and all shell-fish to grow larger and again smaller in bulk, and moreover that the phases of the moon affect the tissues of the shrewmouse, and that the smallest animal, the ant, is sensitive to the influence of the planet and at the time of the new moon is always slack. this makes ignorance all the more disgraceful to man, especially as he admits that with some cattle diseases of the eyes increase and diminish with the moon. his excuse is the heaven's vastness, being divided at an enormous height into 72 signs, that is, shapes of things or of animals into which the learned have mapped out the sky. in them they have indeed noted 1600 stars as being specially remarkable for their influence or their appearance, for instance the seven which they have named the pleiades in the tail of the bull and the little pigs in his forehead, and bootes the star that follows the seven plough-oxen.
