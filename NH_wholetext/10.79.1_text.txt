pigeons go through a special ceremony of kissing before mating. they usually lay two eggs at a time, nature so regulating as to make some produce larger chicks and others more numerous. the woodpigeon and the turtledove lay at most three eggs at a time, and never more than twice in a spring, and keeping a rule that, if the former lay goes bad, even although they lay three eggs they never rear more than two chicks; the third egg, which is unfertile, they call a wind-egg. the hen woodpigeon sits from noon till the next morning and the cock the rest of the time. pigeons always lay a male and a female egg, the male first and the female a day later. in this species both birds sit, the cock in the daytime and the hen at night. they hatch in about three weeks, and they lay four days after mating. in summer indeed they sometimes produce three pairs of chickens every two months, for they hatch on the 17th day and breed immediately; consequently eggs are often found among the chickens, and some are beginning to fly just when others are breaking the egg. then the chicks themselves begin laying when five months old. however in the absence of a cock hen birds actually mate with one another indifferently, and produce unfertile eggs from which nothing is produced, which the greeks call wind-eggs.
