i have already said that the choicest mistletoe is thought to come from the hard-wood oak, and i have given the way of preparing it. some crush it and boil in water until none of it floats on the surface; others chew the berries and spit out the skins. the best birdlime from mistletoe is without any skin, and very smooth, yellow on the outside and leek-green within. nothing is more sticky than this birdlime. it is emollient, disperses tumours, and dries up scrofulous sores; with resin and wax it softens superficial abscesses of every sort. some add galbanum also, equal in weight to each of the other ingredients, and this mixture they use also for the treatment of wounds. the lime smoothes scabrous nails, but the application must be taken off every seven days and the nails washed with a solution of soda. some superstitiously believe that the mistletoe proves more efficacious if it be gathered from the hard-wood oak at the new moon without the use of iron, and without its touching the ground; that so it cures epilepsy, helps women to conceive if they merely a carry it on their persons; that chewed and applied to sores it heals them most effectively.
