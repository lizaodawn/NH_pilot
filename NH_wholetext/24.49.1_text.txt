the plant called cissos erythranos by the greeks is like ivy. taken in wine it is good for sciatica and lumbago; so strong is the property of the berry that it brings away blood in the urine. chamaecissos again is the name they give to an ivy that never rises from the ground. this too crushed in wine and taken in doses of an acetabulum cures splenic trouble; the leaves with axle-grease are applied to bums. the milax also, which has the further name of anthophoros (flower-bearer), has a likeness to the ivy, though the leaves are more slender. a chaplet of it made with an odd number of leaves is said to be a cure for headache. some authorities have declared that there are two kinds of milax. one is very nearly everlasting, grows in shaded valleys, is a climber of trees, bears berries in luxuriant clusters, and is most efficacious against all poisonous things to such a degree that, if the juice of the berries is repeatedly administered in drops to babies, no poison will hereafter do them any harm. the other kind is said to be fond of cultivated ground and to grow there, having no medicinal value. the former milax they state to be the one the wood of which, we said, gives out a sound when placed close to the ear. like it is the plant that some have called elematis, which climbs along trees and is itself jointed. its leaves cleanse leprous sores; its seed loosens the bowels if an acetabulum of it is taken in a hemina of water or in hydromel. a decoction of it is administered for the same purpose.
