relative to the fortunate islands, juba has ascertained the following facts: that they are situate to the south in nearly a due westerly direction, and at a distance from the purple islands of six hundred and twenty-five miles, the sailing being made for two hundred and fifty miles due west, and then three hundred and seventy-five towards the east. he states that the first is called ombrios, and that it presents no traces of buildings whatever; that among the mountains there is a lake, and some trees, which bear a strong resemblance to giant fennel, and from which water is extracted; that drawn from those that are black is of a bitter taste, but that produced by the white ones is agreeable and good for drinking. he states also that a second island has the name of junonia, but that it contains nothing beyond a small temple of stone: also that in its vicinity there is another, but smaller, island of the same name, and then another called capraria, which is infested by multitudes of huge lizards. according to the same author, in sight of these islands is ninguaria, which has received that name from its perpetual snows; this island abounds also in fogs. the one next to it is canaria; it contains vast multitudes of dogs of very large size, two of which were brought home to juba: there are some traces of buildings to be seen here. while all these islands abound in fruit and birds of every kind, this one produces in great numbers the date palm which bears the caryota, also pine nuts. honey too abounds here, and in the rivers papyrus, and the fish called silurus, are found. these islands, however, are greatly annoyed by the putrefying bodies of monsters, which are constantly thrown up by the sea.
