in the same region grows the aspalathus, a white thorn of the size of a moderate-sized tree, with the flower of a rose; the root is in request for unguents. people say that any shrub over which a rainbow forms its arch gives out a scent as sweet as that of the aspalathus, but that if this happens in the case of an aspalathus a scent rises that is indescribably sweet. some call this shrub red sceptre and others sceptre. the test of its genuineness lies in its fiery red colour, firmness to the touch and scent like that of beaver-oil. it is sold for 5 denarii a pound.
