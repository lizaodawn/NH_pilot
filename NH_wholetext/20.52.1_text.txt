mentastrum is wild mint, differing from the cultivated kind in the appearance of its leaves, which have the shape of those of ocimum and the smell of pennyroyal, for which reason some call it wild pennyroyal. if these leaves are chewed and applied, elephantiasis is cured, as was discovered in the time of pompeius magnus by the chance experiment of some one who for shame smeared his face with them. the same leaves are applied, or taken in drink, for the bites of serpents, in doses of two drachmae in two cyathi of wine, for the stings of scorpions with salt, oil and vinegar; for the wound of the scolopendra the juice of a decoction is used. the leaves are dried to a powder and kept as an antidote for all poisons. spread out or burnt, the plant drives away even scorpions. taken in drink it brings on menstruation, but it kills the foetus. for ruptures, spasms, orthopnoea, cholic and cholera it is very beneficial, and an external application is so for lumbago and gout. the juice is injected into ears that are infected with parasites. it is taken in drink for jaundice, and applied as ointment for scrofula; it prevents amorous dreams, and if taken in vinegar expels worms; for dandruff, vinegar with the plant in it is poured over the head in the sun.
