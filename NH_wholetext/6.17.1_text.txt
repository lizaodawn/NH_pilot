media and the caspian gates: ecbatana, the capital of media, was built by king seleucus, at a distance from great seleucia of seven hundred and fifty miles, and twenty miles from the caspian gates. the remaining towns of the medians are phazaca, aganzaga, and apamea, surnamed rhagiane. the reason of these passes receiving the name of "gates," is the same that has been stated above. the chain of mountains is suddenly broken by a passage of such extreme narrowness that, for a distance of eight miles, a single chariot can barely find room to move along: the whole of this pass has been formed by artificial means. both on the right hand and the left are overhanging rocks, which look as though they had been exposed to the action of fire; and there is a tract of country, quite destitute of water, twenty-eight miles in extent. this narrow pass, too, is rendered still more difficult by a liquid salt which oozes from the rocks, and uniting in a single stream, makes its way along the pass. besides this, it is frequented by such multitudes of serpents, that the passage is quite impracticable except in winter.
