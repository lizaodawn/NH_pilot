some people have six fingers on each hand. it has come down to us that the two daughters of a man of patrician family named marcus coranius were called the miss six-fingers on this account, and that voleatius sedigitus was distinguished in poetry. the human fingers have three joints and the thumb two, and it bends in the opposite direction to all the fingers, stretching out by itself on a slant, and it is thicker than the others. the thumb is equal to the smallest finger in length, and two of the rest are equal to one another, between them the middle finger extending longest. the four-footed animals that live by plunder have five toes on the front feet and four on the others. lions, wolves, dogs and the leopard have five claws on the hind feet as well, with the one next the joint of the leg hanging down; the other species, which are smaller, have five toes also.
