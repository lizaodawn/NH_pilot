vegetables sown in autumn or spring are the lentil and in greece the pea. the lentil likes a thin soil better than a rich one, and in any case a dry climate. egypt has two kinds of lentil, one rounder and blacker, the other the normal shape, which has given the name of lenticle applied to small flasks. i find it stated in writers that a lentil diet conduces to an equable temper. peas must be sown in sunny places, as they stand cold very badly; consequently in italy and in severer climates they are only sown in spring, in yielding soil that has been well loosened.
