in egypt too are the pyramids, which must be mentioned, if only cursorily. they rank as a superfluous and foolish display of wealth on the part of the kings, since it is generally recorded that their motive for building them was to avoid providing funds for their successors or for rivals who wished to plot against them, or else to keep the common folk occupied. much vanity was shown by these kings in regard to such enterprises, and the remains of several unfinished pyramids are still in existence. there is one in the nome of arsinoe, and there are two in that of memphis, not far from the labyrinth, a work which also will be described. two more stand in a position once occupied by lake moeris, which is merely a vast excavation, but is nevertheless recorded by the egyptians as one of their remarkable and memorable achievements. the points of these pyramids are said to tower above the surface of the water. the other three pyramids, the fame of which has reached every part of the world, are of course visible to travellers approaching by river from any direction. they stand on a rocky hill in the desert on the african side of the river between the city of memphis and what, as we have already explained, is known as the delta, at a point less than 4 miles from the nile, and 7 1/2 miles from memphis. close by is a village called busiris, where there are people who are used to climbing these pyramids.
