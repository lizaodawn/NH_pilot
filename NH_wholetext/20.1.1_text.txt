from this point we are going to deal with a most important work of nature, namely to tell man his proper foods, and to force him to acknowledge that his means of living are unknown to him. nobody should be deceived by the meanness of the names into considering this a petty or trifling task. herein will be told of nature at peace or at war with herself, along with the hatreds and friendships of things deaf and dumb, and even without feeling. moreover, to increase our wonder, all of them are for the sake of mankind. the greeks have applied the terms 'sympathy' and 'antipathy' to this basic principle of all things: water putting out fire; the sun absorbing water while the moon gives it birth; each of these heavenly bodies suffering eclipse through the injustice of the other. furthermore, to leave the more heavenly regions, the magnetic stone draws iron to itself while another kind of stone repels it; the diamond, the rare delight of wealth, unbreakable and invincible by all other force, is broken by goat's blood. other marvels, equally or even more wonderful, we shall speak of in their proper place. i only ask pardon for beginning with trivial though healthful objects. first i shall deal with kitchen-garden plants.
