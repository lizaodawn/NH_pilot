the reindeer of scythia also changes its colours, but none other of the fur-clad animals does so except the indian wolf, which is reported to have a mane on the neck. for the jackal — which is a kind of wolf, longer in the body and differing in the shortness of the legs, quick in its spring, living by hunting, harmless to man — changes its raiment though not its colour, being shaggy through the winter but naked in summer. the reindeer is the size of an ox; its head is larger than that of a stag but not unlike it; it has branching horns, cloven hooves, and a fleece as shaggy as a bear's but, when it happens to be self-coloured, resembling an ass's coat. the hide is so hard that they use it for making cuirasses. when alarmed it imitates the colours of all the trees, bushes and flowers and places where it lurks, and consequently is rarely caught. it would be surprising that its body has such variety of character, but it is more surprising that even its fleece has.
