empetros, called calcifraga by us romans, is found on coastal mountains, generally on a rock. when it has grown near the sea it is salt, and taken in drink brings away bile and phlegms; when farther off and in deeper soil it tastes more bitter. it brings away fluid, and is taken in broth of some kind or in hydromel. when stale it loses its potency, but when fresh and boiled down in water or beaten up it is diuretic and breaks up stone in the bladder. those who seek to win belief in this assurance assert that pebbles boiled with it are broken up.
