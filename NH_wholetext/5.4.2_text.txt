we next come to the greater syrtis, 625 miles in circumference, and at the entrance 312 miles in width; next after which dwells the nation of the cisippades. at the bottom of this gulf was the coast of the lotophagi, whom some writers have called the alachroae, extending as far as the altars of the philaeni; these altars are formed of heaps of sand. on passing these, not far from the shore there is a vast swamp which receives the river triton and from it takes its name: by callimachus it is called pallantias, and is said by him to be on the nearer side of the lesser syrtis; many other writers however place it between the two syrtes. the promontory which bounds the greater syrtis has the name of borion; beyond it is the province of cyrene.
