we give the name of apples, although they really belong to a different kind, to peaches and to pomegranates, of which we have specified nine kinds among the trees of carthage. pomegranates contain a kernel enclosed in a skin, but peaches have a hard stone inside them. moreover one variety of pear called the pound pear asserts by its name the largeness of its weight. but the palm among peaches belongs to the nectarine: the gallic and the asiatic varieties are named after their nationalities. the asiatic peach ripens at the end of autumn, though an early variety ripens in summer - these were discovered within the last thirty years, and were at first sold for a denarius apiece. the adriatic peach comes from samnium, but the common peach grows everywhere. it is a harmless fruit, in demand for invalids, and peaches have before now fetched thirty sesterces each, a price exceeded by no other fruit - which may surprise us, because there is none which keeps worse: the longest time that it will last after being plucked is two days, and it compels you to put it on the market.
