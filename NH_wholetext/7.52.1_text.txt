the ex-consul aviola came to life again on the funeral pyre, and as the flame was too powerful for it to be possible to come to his assistance, was burnt alive. a similar cause of death is recorded in the case of the ex-praetor lucius lamia, while gaius aelius tubero, a former praetor, is recorded by messala rufus and most authorities to have been recovered from the pyre. this is the law of mortals: we are born for these and similar accidents of fortune, so that in the case of a human being no confidence must he placed even in death. among other instances we find that the soul of hermotimus of clazomenae used to leave his body and roam abroad, and in its wanderings report to him from a distance many things that only one present at them could know of — his body in the meantime being only half-conscious; till finally some enemies of his named the cantharidae burned his body and so deprived his soul on its return of what may be called its sheath. we also read that the soul of aristeas at proconnesus was seen flying out of his mouth in the shape of a raven, with a great deal of fabulous invention that follows this. this inventiveness i for my part also receive in a similar way in the case of epimenides of cnossus — that when a boy, being weary with the heat and with travel, he slept in a cave 57 years, and when he woke, just as if it had been on the following day, was surprised at the appearance of things and the change in them; and afterwards old age came on him in the same number of days as he had slept years, though nevertheless he lived to the age of 157. the female sex seems specially liable to this malady, caused by distortion of the womb; if this is set right, the breathing is restored. to this subject belongs the essay of heraclides, well known in greece, about the woman recalled to life after being dead for seven days.
