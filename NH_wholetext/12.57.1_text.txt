pure galbanum is only useful for medicinal purposes; but syria produces all-heal which is used for unguents as well. it also grows at psophis in arcadia and round the spring of erymanthus, and in africa and in macedonia also. it has a peculiar stalk 7 1/2 feet long; this throws out first four leaves and then six lying on the ground, which are very large and of a round shape, but the leaves on the top of the plant are like those of the olive; the seed hangs in tufts like that of the fennel. the juice is got by means of incisions made in the stalk at harvest time and at the root in autumn. it is valued for whiteness when it coagulates, the next grade being assigned to juice of a pale colour, while the black is held of no value. the price of the best quality is two denarii a pound.
