i must describe too the character of the onyx proper, which shares its name with the sardonyx. elsewhere, this name is given to a stone, but here it is that of a gem. sudines states that in onyx one finds a white band resembling a human fingernail, as well as the colour of the 'chrysolith,' the sard and the iaspis, while zenothemis mentions that the indian onyx has several different colours, fiery red, black and that of horn, surrounded by a white layer as in an eye, and in some cases traversed by a slanting layer. sotacus records also an arabian onyx which differs from the indian in that the latter displays a small fiery red layer surrounded by one or more white bands (the arrangement being unlike that of the indian sardonyx, where the top red layer is a circle, and not, as in this instance, a dot). on the other hand, the arabian onyx, according to him, is found to be black with white bands. satyrus states that there is an indian onyx that is flesh-coloured, with a part of it resembling the 'carbunculus,' and a part, the 'chrysolith' and the amethyst. this kind he wholly rejects as spurious, asserting that a genuine onyx has several bands of different colours combined with others that are milk-white, the colours as the bands shade into each other being quite indescribable as they are reduced to a harmonious and delightfully agreeable unity.
