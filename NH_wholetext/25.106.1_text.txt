erigeron is called by us romans senecio. if a line is traced round it with an iron tool before it is dug up, and if one touches a painful tooth with the plant three times, spitting after each touch, and replaces it into its original ground so as to keep it alive, it is said that the tooth will never cause pain thereafter. this plant has the appearance and softness of trixago, with small, reddish stems. it grows on tiled roofs and on walls. its name was given to it by the greeks, because it is of a hoary colour in spring. its head is divided by many pieces of down, like those of a thorn, that grow out from between the divisions, which is why callimachus gave it the name of acanthis, and others pappus. apart from this, however, the greeks are not in agreement about this plant. some have said that it has the leaves of rocket, others of the oak but much smaller; some that the root is useless, others that it is good for the sinews, others that it chokes if taken in drink. on the other hand some have given it with wine for jaundice, and as a cure for all complaints of the bladder, heart, and liver. they have said that it brings away gravel from the kidneys. they prescribed for sciatica a drachma with oxynael after a walk, this dose being also very useful in raisin wine for colic; they recommended it also as a salad with vinegar for the internal organs a generally, and they planted it in gardens. there have been some who distinguished a second variety, but without pointing out its qualities, prescribing it to be taken in water for snake bite, and to be eaten by epileptics. i myself shall treat of it only in so far as the romans have found out by experiment how to use it. its down, with saffron and a little cold water, is applied crushed to eye fluxes and, roasted with a grain of salt, to scrofulous sores.
