there is one marvellous instance of the transmission of a spoken message: the battle that resulted in the destruction of sybaris was heard of at olympia on the day on which it was fought. for the messengers who brought news of the victory over the cimbri and the brothers castor who reported the victory over perseus to the romans on the very day on which it happened were visions and warnings sent by the divine powers.
