alica is peculiarly roman, and a discovery of recent date, or the greeks would not have sung the praises of barley water in preference. it was in my opinion not yet used in the age of pompey the great, and for that reason scarcely anything about it has been written by the school of asclepiades. its extreme usefulness nobody doubts, whether it is given in hydromel after straining or boiled down to gruel or to thick pottage. for arresting looseness of the bowels alica is roasted, and then honeycomb wax is cooked with it, as i have said above. it is however specially useful for those who by long illness have been reduced to a consumptive condition; the dose is three cyathi put into a sextarius of water and gradually boiled down until all the water has evaporated, when a sextarius of sheep's or goats' milk is added, and the mixture taken daily; after a while honey also is added. by a course of this gruel decline is arrested.
