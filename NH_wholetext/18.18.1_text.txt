barley meal is used as a medicine, and it is remarkable how in treating cattle pills made of it after it has been hardened by roasting at the fire and afterwards ground, sent down into the animal's stomach by the human hand, serve to increase the strength and enlarge the muscles of the body. some ears of barley have two rows of grains and some more, up to as many as six. in the grain itself there are some varieties: it is longer and smoother or shorter and rounder, lighter or darker in colour, the kind with a purple shade being of a rich consistency for porridge; the light-coloured grain offers the weakest resistance to storms. barley is the softest of all the grains. it likes to be sown only in a dry, loose soil, which must also be of rich quality. its chaff is one of the best, indeed for straw there is none that compares with it. barley is the least liable to damage of all corn, because it is harvested before the wheat is attacked by mildew (and so wise farmers only sow wheat for the larder, whereas barley is sown by the sack, as the saying is), and consequently it brings in a return very quickly; and the most prolific kind is the barley harvested at carthage in spain in the month of april. in celtiberia this barley is sown in the same month, and there are two crops in the same year. all barley is cut sooner than any other grain, as soon as it first ripens, because the grain is carried on a brittle straw and contained in a very thin chaff. moreover we are told that it makes better pearl-barley if it is lifted before its ripening has been completed.
