hierax's salve is the name given to an eye-salve chiefly composed of verdigris. it is made by mixing together four ounces of gum hammoniac, two of cyprian verdigris, two of the copperas called flower of copper, one of misy and six of saffron; all these ingredients are pounded in thasian vinegar and made up into pills, that are an outstanding specific against incipient glaucoma and cataract, and also against films on the eyes or roughnesses and white ulcerations in the eye and affections of the eyelids. verdigris in a crude state is used as an ingredient in plasters for wounds also. in combination with oil it is a marvellous cure for ulcerations of the mouth and gums and for sore lips, and if wax is also added to the mixture it cleanses them and makes them form a cicatrix. verdigris also eats away the callosity of fistulas and of sores round the anus, either applied by itself or with gum of ilammon, or inserted into the fistula in the manner of a salve. verdigris kneaded up with a third part of turpentine also removes leprosy.
