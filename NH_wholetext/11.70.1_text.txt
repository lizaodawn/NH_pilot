the view is held that dull creatures are those whose heart is stiff and hard, bold ones those whose heart is small, and cowardly ones those in which it is specially large; but it is largest in proportion to their size in mice, the hare, the ass, the stag, the leopard, weasels, hyenas, and all the species that are either timid or rendered dangerous by fear. partridges in paphlagonia have two hearts. bones are occasionally found in the heart of horses and oxen. the people of egypt, who practise the custom of mummification, have a belief that the human heart grows larger every year and at the age of fifty reaches a weight of a quarter of an ounce, and from that point loses weight at the same rate; and that consequently a man does not live beyond a hundred, owing to heart failure. it is stated that some people are born with a hairy heart, and that they are exceptionally brave and resolute â€” an example being a messenian named aristomenes who killed three hundred spartans. he himself when severely wounded and taken prisoner for. the first time escaped through a cave from confinement in the quarries by following the routes by which foxes got in. he was again taken prisoner, but when his guards were fast asleep he rolled to the fire and burnt off his thongs, burning his body in the process. he was taken a third time, and the spartans cut him open alive and his heart was found to be shaggy.
