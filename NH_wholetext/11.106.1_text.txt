only with animals of the draught kind do the hooves grow again. in some places in illyria pigs have solid hooves. horned animals mostly have cloven hooves. no species has both solid hooves and two horns; the only animal with one horn is the rhinoceros, and the only one with one horn and cloven hooves the antelope. the rhinoceros is the only solid-hooved animal that has pastern-bones, for pigs are thought to belong to both classes, and consequently their pastern-bones are misshapen. persons who have thought that a human being has pastern-bones have been easily refuted. of the animals with toes only the lynx has something resembling a pastern-bone, and the lion a still more twisted one. but the true pastern-bone is at the ankle-joint, projecting with a hollow bulge and attached with a ligature onto the joint.
