a help against snakebite is also flesh of doves or swallows freshly torn away, and the feet of a homed owl burnt with the herb plumbago. speaking of this bird i will not omit a specimen of magian fraud, for besides their other monstrous lies they declare that an horned owl's heart, placed on the left breast of a sleeping woman, makes her tell all her secrets, and that men carrying it into battle are made braver by it. from the horned owl's egg they prescribe recipes for the hair. now who, i ask, could have ever looked at an horned owl's egg, when it is a portent to have seen the bird itself? who in any case could have tried it, particularly on the hair? the blood, indeed, of a horned owl's chick is guaranteed even to curl the hair. of much the same kind would seem to be also their stories about the bat: that if carried alive three times round the house and then fastened head downwards through the window, it acts as a talisman, and is specifically such to sheepfolds if carried round them three times and hung up by the feet over the threshold. its blood also with thistle the magi praise as one of the sovereign remedies for snakebite.
