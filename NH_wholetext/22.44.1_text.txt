sow-thistle too is edible — at any rate. callimachus makes hecale set it before theseus — both the pale kind and the dark. both are like lettuce, except that they are prickly, with a stem a cubit high, angular and hollow inside, which on being broken streams with a milky juice. the pale kind, which shines because of the milk in it, is good for asthma if taken with salad-dressing as is lettuce. erasistratus informs us that it carries away stone in the urine, and that to chew it purifies foul breath. three cyathi of the juice warmed in white wine and oil aid delivery, but the expectant mother must take a walk immediately after drinking it; it is also given in broth. a decoction of the stem itself makes the milk abundant in nurses and improves the complexion of the babies, being very useful to those women who are subject to curdling their milk. the juice is injected into the ears, and a cyathus of it is drunk warm for strangury, for gnawing pains of the stomach with cucumber seed and pine nuts. it is used also externally for abscesses at the anus. it is taken in drink for the poison of snakes and scorpions, but the root is used as an external application. boiled in oil and in the skin of a pomegranate the root is also a remedy for complaints of the ears. all these preparations must be made from the white kind. cleemporus says that the dark kind must not be eaten, because it causes diseases, but he agrees to the use of the white. agathocles asserts that its juice counteracts even the poison of bull's blood, yet since it is agreed that the dark kind has cooling properties, pearl barley must therefore be added to the application. zeno recommends the root of the white kind for strangury.
