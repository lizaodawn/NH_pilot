a third kind of tortoise lives in mud and marshes. these have a level width, like that across the breast, over the back also; this is not rounded into a cup-like convexity â€” indeed an unpleasant sight. yet from this creature also a few remedies are obtained. for three are together thrown on burning brushwood, and when the shells separate they are at once taken off; the flesh is then torn away and boiled in a congius of water with a little salt added. the broth is boiled down to one third and taken for paralysis and diseases of the joints. the gall of this creature carries off phlegms and vitiated blood. this remedy taken in cold water acts astringently on the bowels.
