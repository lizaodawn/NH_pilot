in the age too of our fathers king juba discovered a plant to which he gave the name euphorbea, calling it after his own physician euphorbus. this man was the brother of the musa we have as the saviour of the life of the late emperor augustus. it was these brothers who first adopted the plan of bracing the body by copious douches of cold water after the bath. before this the custom was to bathe in hot water only, as we find that it is also in homer. but the treatise also of juba on this plant is still extant, and it makes a splendid testimonial. he discovered it on mount atlas; it has the appearance of a thyrsus and the leaves of the acanthus. its potency is so great that the juice, obtained by incision with a pole, is gathered from a distance; it is caught in receivers made of kids' stomachs placed underneath. fluid and like milk as it drops down, when it has dried and congealed it has all the features of frankincense. the collectors find their vision improved. it is employed as treatment for snakebite. in whatever part of the body the bite may be, an incision is made in the top of the skull and the medicament inserted there. the gaetulians who gather the juice adulterate it out of weary disgust by adding milk, but fire is a test of genuineness, for that which is adulterated emits a nauseating smell. far inferior to the atlas juice is that which in gaul comes from the ground-olive, which bears a red berry like kermes. broken it resembles hammoniacum, and even a slight taste leaves for a long time a burning sensation in the mouth; after a while this increases until it dries up even the throat.
