the very bread which forms our staple diet has almost innumerable medicinal properties. applied in water and oil or in rose oil it softens abscesses; in hydromel it is very soothing to indurations. in wine it is given to disperse or to compress as need may be, and, if greater strength be called for, in vinegar for those violent fluxes of phlegm which the greeks call rheumatism, as well as for bruises and sprains. for all purposes, however, leavened bread, of the kind called autopyrus, is the more beneficial. in vinegar it is also applied to whitlows and to callosities on the feet. stale bread or sailors' bread, pounded and then baked again, checks looseness of the bowels. for those anxious to improve the voice and for catarrhs it is very beneficial to eat dry bread at breakfast. sitanins, that is bread made of three-month wheat, applied with honey is a very good cure for bruises on the face or scaly eruptions. white bread soaked in warm or cold water affords a very light food for invalids. in wine it is applied to swollen eyes, and in this form or with the addition of dried myrtle to pustules on the head. persons with palsy are recommended to eat bread soaked in water, fasting, and immediately after the bath. moreover, bread burnt in bedrooms removes the close smell, and put in the strainers any unpleasant odour in wine.
