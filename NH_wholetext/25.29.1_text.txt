eupatoria too enjoys the prestige of a royal discoverer. it has a ligneous stem, dark, hairy, and a cubit or sometimes more in height; the leaves, arranged at intervals, are like those of cinquefoil or hemp, and have five indentations along the edge; they too are dark and feathery. the root is useless, but the seed taken in wine is a sovereign remedy in cases of dysentery.
