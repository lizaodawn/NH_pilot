alsine, which some call myosoton, is found in groves; hence its name. it begins to grow just after midwinter, and withers at midsummer. when it puts forth its leaves, they are like the ears of little mice. however, i shall describe another plant, to which more properly would be given the name myosotis. alsine would be just the same as helxine, were it not that it is smaller and less hairy. it grows in gardens and especially on walls. when being bruised it smells like cucumber. it is used for gatherings and inflammations, and for all purposes for which helxine is employed, but with less efficacy. especially is it applied to eye fluxes, and with barley meal to sore genitals and ulcers. its juice is poured into the ears.
