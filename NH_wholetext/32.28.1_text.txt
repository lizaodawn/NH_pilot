ulcers in the mouth are healed by the brine of menae, and by their heads reduced to ash and applied with honey. for scrofulous sores it is good to prick them, but not causing a wound, with the little bone from the tail of the fish called the sea-frog. this should be done daily, until the cure is complete. the same property is possessed by the sting of the stingray and by the sea-hare, but the application must be quickly removed, with the shells of the urchin crushed and applied in vinegar, by the sea-scolopendra too applied in honey, and by river-crabs, crushed or burnt and applied in honey. wonderfully good too are the bones of cuttlefish crushed with old axle-grease and applied. the same prescription is used for parotid swellings as well, as is the liver of the horse-mackerel, and even the crushed pieces of a jar in which fish have been salted, applied with old axle-grease; the ash of the murex is applied with oil for parotid swellings and scrofulous sores.
