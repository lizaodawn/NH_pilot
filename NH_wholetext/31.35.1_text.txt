what is called thalassomeli is a mixture, kept till old, of sea water, honey, and rain water in equal proportions. for this purpose too the water is brought from out at sea, and the mixture is stored in an earthenware vessel lined with pitch. it is good especially for purges, does not disturb the stomach, and has a pleasant flavour and smell.
