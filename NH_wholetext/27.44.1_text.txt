the pounded leaves of eucullus with vinegar cure the bites of serpents and the stings of scorpions. some give this plant another name, strumus, others the greek name of strychnus. it has black berries; a cyathus of juice from these, with two of honey wine, is good treatment for lumbago, as also for headache if used with rose oil for bathing the brow, while for serofulous sores the plant itself is applied locally.
