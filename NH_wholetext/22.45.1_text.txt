condrion or condrille has leaves like those of endive, eaten away as it were round the edges, a stem less than a foot and moist with a bitter juice, and a root like a bean, occasionally manifold. next to the ground it grows a gum, an excrescence the size of a bean, a pessary of which is said to promote menstruation. the whole with the roots is pounded and divided into lozenges as an antidote for snakebites, for which treatment good reason can be adduced, for field mice wounded by snakes are said to eat it. a decoction of the plant in wine checks looseness of the bowels. the same makes an excellent substitute for gum to keep the eyelashes tidy, however disordered these may be. dorotheus declares in his verses that it is good for the stomach and the digestion. for the rest, it has been supposed to be bad for women, for the eyes, and for the virility of men.
