hellebore is never prescribed for old people or children, or for those who are soft and effeminate in body or mind, or for the thin or delicate; for women it is less suited than for men, unsuitable too for the nervous or when the hypochondria are ulcerated or swollen, very bad when there is spitting of blood, pain in the side, or sore throat. applied externally with salted axle-grease it cures pituitous eruptionse on the body and also suppurations of long standing. mixed with pearl barley it kills rats and mice. the gauls when hunting dip their arrows in hellebore, and say that the meat when the flesh round the wound has been cut away tastes more tender. flies too die if pounded white hellebore and milk are sprinkled about. phthiriasis too is cured by the same preparation.
