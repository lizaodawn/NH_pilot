but with a human being black gall contains the cause of insanity, and when it is all excreted death follows. hence the reproach made against a man's character under the term 'bile': so powerful a poison is contained in this part when it spreads to the mind. moreover when it is diffused all over the body it takes away the colour even of the eyes, and indeed, when excreted, even from bronze vessels, which turn black when touched by it â€” so that nobody need be surprised that snakes' gall is poison. (animals in the pontus that eat wormwood are free from bile.) again the gall-bladder is connected with the kidneys and only on one side with the intestine in ravens, quails and pheasants, and in some only with the intestine, as in pigeons, the hawk, lampreys; and with a few birds it is in the liver. with snakes it is proportionally extremely copious, and so with fishes. but with birds it usually fills the whole intestine, as with the hawk and kite; moreover it is also in the liver, as in the case of all the large marine animals. indeed in the case of seals it is in high repute for many purposes as well. from bulls' gall a golden colour is extracted. the augurs have consecrated the gall to neptune and the power of the watery element, and the late lamented augustus found a double gall-bladder on the day on which he won the battle of actium.
