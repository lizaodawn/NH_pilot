in spain too was discovered cantabrica, found by the cantabri in the period of the late emperor augustus. it grows everywhere, having a rush-like stem a foot in length, on which are small, longish flowers, shaped like a work-basket, in which are very tiny seeds. nor have the spains been backward in other search after plants; for example, even now today it is the custom at the more festive gatherings, to mix a drink, the 'hundred-plant potion', by adding to honey wine a hundred plants, in the belief that such is both very healthful and very pleasant. nobody, however, now knows the kinds of plants used and their exact number, although a definite number is given in the name.
