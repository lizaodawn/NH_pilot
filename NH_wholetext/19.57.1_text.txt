garden vegetables are also liable to disease, like the rest of the plants on earth. for instance basil degenerates with old age into wild-thyme and sisymbrium into mint, and old cabbage seed produces turnip, and so on. also cummin is killed by broom-rape unless it is thoroughly cleaned: this is a plant with a single stalk and a root resembling a bulb, and it only grows in a thin soil. another disease peculiar to cummin is scab. also basil turns pale at the rising of the dog-star. all plants indeed turn yellow when a woman comes near them at her monthly period. also various insects breed on garden plants - springtails in turnips, caterpillars and maggots in radish, and also on lettuces and cabbage, both of which are more infested by slugs and snails than radish; and the leek has special insects of its own, which are easily caught by throwing dung on the plants, as they burrow into it. according to sabinus tiro in his book on gardening, which he dedicated to maecenas, it is also bad for rue, savoury, mint or basil to come in contact with iron.
