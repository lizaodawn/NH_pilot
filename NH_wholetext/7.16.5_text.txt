we find in the records that at salamis the son of euthymenes grew to 4 ft. 6 in. in his third year; he walked slowly, was dull of sense, became sexually quite mature, had a bass voice, and was carried off by a sudden attack of paralysis when he turned three. we ourselves recently saw almost all these features except sexual maturity in a son of the knight of rome cornelius tacitus, deputy finance minister in belgic gaul. the greeks call these cases 'perverts,' but in the latin country there is no name for them.
