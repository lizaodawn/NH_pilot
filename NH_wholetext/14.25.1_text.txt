of the trees which distil a juice, some growing in the east and others in europe produce pitch and resin, and the province of asia, which lies between the two, has some of both sorts. in the east the best and finest resin is produced by the turpentine-tree, and next by the lentisk — the latter being also called gum-mastic; afterwards comes the juice of the cypress, which has a very sharp flavour — all of these trees producing a liquid juice and merely a resin, whereas the juice of the cedar is thicker and suitable for making pitch. arabian resin is white and has a sharp scent, stifling to a person engaged in boiling it; the resin of judea dries harder and has a stronger scent than even that from the turpentine-tree; and syrian resin has a resemblance to attic honey. the resin of cyprus excels all other kinds; it likewise is the colour of honey, and has a fleshy consistency. that of colophon is yellower than the rest, but if ground up turns white; it has a rather oppressive scent, and consequently the perfumers do not make use of it. in asia a very white resin is made from the pitch-pine; it is called psagdas. all resin can be dissolved in oil, and some people think that potter's chalk can also be so dissolved; and i am ashamed to confess that the chief value now set on resin is for use as a depilatory for men.
