to cut the nails on the market days at rome in silence, beginning with the forefinger, is a custom many people feel binding on them; while to cut the hair on the seventeenth day of the month and on the twenty-ninth prevents its falling out as well as headaches. a country rule observed on most italian farms forbids women to twirl their spindles while walking along the road, or even to carry them uncovered, on the ground that such action blights the hopes of everything, especially the hope of a good harvest. marcus servilius nonianus, a leading citizen of rome, who was not so long ago afraid of ophthalmia, used to tie round his neck, before he mentioned the disease himself or any one else spoke to him about it, a sheet of paper fastened with thread, on which were written the two greek letters rho and alpha; mucianus, three times consul, following the same observance, used a living fly in a white linen bag. both avowed that by these remedies they themselves were kept free from ophthalmia. we certainly still have formulas to charm away hail, various diseases, and burns, some actually tested by experience, but i am very shy of quoting them, because of the widely different feelings they arouse. wherefore everyone must form his own opinion about them as he pleases.
