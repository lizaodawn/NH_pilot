all blooded animals have a brain, and so also have the sea-creatures that we have designated the soft species, although they are bloodless, for instance the polypus [octopus]. man however has the largest brain in proportion to his size and the most moist one, and it is the coldest of all his organs; it is wrapped in two membranes above and below, the fracture of either of which is fatal. for the rest a man's brain is larger than a woman's. with all human beings it has no blood or veins, and in some cases no fat. the learned teach that it is distinct from marrow because boiling makes it hard. in the middle of the brain of all species there are tiny little bones. with man alone the brain throbs in infancy, and does not become firm before the child first begins to talk. the brain is the highest of the organs in position, and it is protected by the vault of the head; it has no flesh or blood or refuse. it is the citadel of sense-perception, and the focus to which all the flow of the veins converges from the heart and at which it stops; it is the crowning pinnacle, the seat of government of the mind. but the brain of all animals slopes forward, because our senses also stretch in front of us. it is the source of sleep and the cause of drowsy nodding; species without a brain do not sleep.
