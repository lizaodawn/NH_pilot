when the bite of a mad dog causes a dread of drink they rub the face with the fat of a seal, with more effect if there are mixed with it the marrow of a hyena, mastic oil, and wax. the bites of the murry are healed by the head of the murry itself, reduced to ash. for the wound of the stingray a remedy is the ash, of the same ray itself or of any other specimen, applied locally in vinegar. when the fish is used as food there should be taken from its back whatever is like saffron, and the whole head removed, while the ray, and all shell fish, when used as food, should not be over-washed, as to do so spoils the flavour. the poison of the sea-hare is counteracted by the seahorse taken in drink. sea-urchins are very good as an antidote to dorycnium, as they are also for those who have drunk juice of carpathium, especially if they are taken in their broth. effective against dorycnium is also considered a decoction of sea-crab, and indeed specific for the poison of the sea-hare.
