in gold and silver mines also are formed the pigments yellow ochre and blue. yellow ochre is strictly speaking a slime. the best kind comes from what is called attic slime; its price is two denarii a pound. the next best is marbled ochre, which costs half the price of attic. the third kind is dark ochre, which other people call scyric ochre, as it comes from the island of scyros, and nowadays also from achaia, which they use for the shadows of a painting, price two sesterces a pound, while that called clear ochre, coming from gaul, costs two asses less. this and the attic kind they use for painting different kinds of light, but only marbled ochre for squared panel designs, because the marble in it resists the acridity of the lime. this ochre is also dug up in the mountains 20 miles from rome. it is afterwards burnt, and by some people it is adulterated and passed off as dark ochre; but the fact that it is not genuine and has been burnt is shown by its acridity and by its crumbling into dust.
