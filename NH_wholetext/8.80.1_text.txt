the kinds of apes also which are closest to the human shape are distinguished from each other by the tails. they are marvellously cunning: people say that they use bird-lime as ointment, and that they put on the nooses set to snare them as if they were shoes, in imitation of the hunters; according to mucianus the tailed species have even been known to play at draughts, are able to distinguish at a glance sham nuts made of wax, and are depressed by the moon waning and worship the new moon with delight: and it is a fact that the other four-footed animals also are frightened by eclipses. the genus ape has a remarkable affection for its young. tame monkeys kept in the house who bear young ones carry them about and show them to everybody, and delight in having them stroked, looking as if they understood that they are being congratulated; and as a consequence in a considerable number of cases they kill their babies by hugging them. the baboon is of a fiercer nature, just as the satyrus is extremely gentle. the pretty-haired ape is almost entirely different in appearance: it has a bearded face and a tail flattened out wide at the base. this animal is said to be unable to live in any other climate but that of its native country, ethiopia.
