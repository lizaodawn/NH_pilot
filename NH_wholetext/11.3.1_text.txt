so far as is perceptible, insects do not appear to possess sinews or bones or spines or cartilage or fat or flesh, and not even a fragile rind, such as some sea creatures have, nor anything that can properly be termed a skin, but a substance of a nature intermediate between all of these, as it were dried up, softer in the sinew but harder or rather more durable in all the other parts. and this is all that they possess, and nothing else in addition; they have no internal organs except, in the case of quite a few, a twisted intestine. consequently when torn asunder they display a remarkable tenacity of life, and the separate parts go on throbbing, because whatever their vital principle is it certainly does not reside in particular members but in the body as a whole - least of all in the head, and this alone does not move unless it has been torn off with the breast. no other kind of creature has a greater number of feet, and of this species the ones that have more feet live longer when torn asunder, as we see in the case of the multipede. but they possess eyes, and also of the other senses touch and taste, and some have smell as well, and a few hearing also.
