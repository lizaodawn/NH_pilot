most men are not acquainted with a truth known to the founders of the science from their arduous study of the heavens, that what when they fall to earth are termed thunderbolts are the fires of the three upper planets, particularly those of jupiter, which is in the middle position â€” possibly because it voids in this way the charge of excessive moisture from the upper circle (of saturn) and of excessive heat from the circle below (of mars); and that this is the origin of the myth that thunderbolts are the javelins hurled by jupiter. consequently heavenly fire is spit forth by the planet as crackling charcoal flies from a burning log, bringing prophecies with it, as even the part of himself that he discards does not cease to function in its divine tasks. and this is accompanied by a very great disturbance of the air, because moisture collected causes an overflow, or because it is disturbed by the birth-pangs so to speak of the planet in travail.
