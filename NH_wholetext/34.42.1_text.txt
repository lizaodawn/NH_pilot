we will speak in the appropriate place about the lodestone and the sympathy which it has with iron. iron is the only substance that catches the infection of that stone and retains it for a long period, taking hold of other iron, so that we may sometimes see a chain of rings; the ignorant lower classes call this 'live iron,' and wounds inflicted with it are more severe. this sort of stone forms in biscaya also not in a continuous rocky stratum like the genuine lodestone alluded to but in a scattered pebbly formation or 'bubbling' â€” that is what they call it. i do not know whether it is equally useful for glass founding, as no one has hitherto tested it, but it certainly imparts the same magnetic property to iron. the architect timochares had begun to use lodestone for constructing the vaulting in the temple of arsinoe at alexandria, so that the iron statue contained in it might have the appearance of being suspended in mid air; but the project was interrupted by his own death and that of king ptolemy who had ordered the work to be done in honour of his sister.
