the biggest of the entire group is the fir, the female being even taller than the male, and its timber softer and more easily worked, and the tree rounder in shape, and with dense feathery foliage, which makes it impervious to rain; and in general it has a more cheerful appearance. from the branches of these species, with the exception of the larch, there hang nut-like growths resembling catkins, packed together like scales. those of the male fir have kernels in their tips, though this is not the case with the female fir; but the nuts of the pitch-pine have kernels filling the whole of the catkins, which are smaller and narrower, the kernels being very small and black, owing to which the greek name for the pitch-pine is a word meaning 'louse-tree.' also in the pitch-pine the nut-growths are more closely packed in the male trees and less moist with resin.
