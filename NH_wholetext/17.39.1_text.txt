now that we have set out the diseases of trees it is suitable also to state the remedies for them. some of these are common to all trees and some peculiar to some of them. remedies common to all are loosening the soil, banking it up, admitting air to the roots or covering them up, making a channel to give them water or to drain it away, dung refreshing them with its juice, pruning to relieve them of weight, also letting out the sap like a surgical blood-letting, scraping a ring of bark, stretching out the vine-sprays and checking the shoots, trimming off and as it were polishing up the buds if they have been shrivelled and roughened by cold weather. some trees like these treatments more and others less, for example the cypress scorns both water and dung and hates being dug round and pruned and all kinds of nursing, in fact irrigation kills it, whereas it is exceptionally nourishing for vines and pomegranates. in the case of the fig irrigation nourishes the tree itself but makes the fruit decay. almond-trees lose their blossom if the ground round them is made clean by being dug over. also trees that have been grafted must not be dug round before they are strong and begin to bear fruit. most trees however want to have their burdensome and superfluous growth pruned away, just as we have our nails and hair cut. old trees are cut down entirely and spring up again from some sucker, but they will not all do this but only those whose nature we have stated to allow of it.
