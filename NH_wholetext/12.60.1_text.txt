there is also the oil of unripe berries, which is made in two varieties and by two processes, one kind being made from the olive and one from the vine. the olive is pressed while still white, or an inferior oil is obtained from the druppa - which is the name given to an olive not yet ripe enough to eat but already beginning to change colour - the difference being that the inferior kind is green and the other white. it is made either from the psithian vine or from the vine of aminaea. the vine is plucked when the grapes are the size of a chick-pea, before the rising of the dog-star, when the first bloom is on them, and the unripe juice is obtained; after which the, remaining pulp is left to dry in the sun - precaution being taken against nocturnal dews, by storing the grapes in an earthenware vessel - while the unripe juice is collected and at once also put to keep in a cyprian bronze jar. the best kind is that which is red in colour and rather bitter and dry to the taste. omphaeium sells at 6 denarii a pound. there is also another way of making it, by pounding up unripe grapes in mortars; the grapes are afterwards dried in the sun and divided up into lozenges.
