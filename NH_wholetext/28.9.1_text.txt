the hair cut off first from a child's head, if tied round the affected part, is said to relieve attacks of gout, as does the application of the hair of all, generally speaking, who have not arrived at puberty. the hair of adult men also, applied with vinegar, is good for dog bites, with oil or wine for wounds on the head. if we believe it, the hair of a man torn from the cross is good for quartan ague; burnt hair is certainly good for carcinoma. the first tooth of a child to fall out, provided that it does not touch the ground, if set in a bracelet and worn constantly on a woman's arm, keeps pain away from her private parts. if the big toe is tied to the one next to it, swellings in the groin are relieved; if the two middle fingers of the right hand are lightly tied together with a linen thread, catarrhs and ophthalmia are kept away. again, a stone voided by a sufferer from bladder trouble, if attached above the pubes, is said to relieve other similar patients as well as pains in the liver, and also to hasten childbirth. granius adds that the stone is more effective for the last purpose if it has been cut out by an iron knife. if the man by whom a woman has conceived unties his girdle and puts it round her waist, and then unties it with the ritual formula: 'i bound, and i too will unloose,' then taking his departure, childbirth is made more rapid.
