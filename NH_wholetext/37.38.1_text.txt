we shall now give a separate account of 'cyanus,' for a short time ago we applied this name to an 'iaspis' owing to its blue colour. the best kind is the scythian, then comes the cyprian and lastly there is the egyptian. it is very commonly counterfeited by tinting other stones, and this is a famous achievement of the kings of egypt, whose records also mention the name of the king who first tinted stones in this way 'cyanus,' too, is divided into male and female varieties. sometimes inside cyanus there is a golden dust, which, however, differs from that which occurs inside lapis lazuli; for there the gold glistens as dots.
