the artificial kinds of wines, the preparation of which i have mentioned, i think to be no longer made and their use superfluous, since i give instructions about the use of the ingredients themselves of which they are composed. in other respects the pretence of physicians about these had exceeded all bounds; for instance, they prescribed navew wine as beneficial for fatigue after military exercises or riding, and to pass over the others, they recommended even juniper wine. and who would prefer to use wormwood wine rather than wormwood itself? among the rest let me omit also palm wine, which is injurious to the head, and only useful as a laxative and to relieve the spitting of blood. that wine cannot be considered artificial which i have called bion, for there is nothing artificial about it except the gathering of unripe grapes. it is good for a disordered stomach or a weak digestion, for pregnancy, faintness, paralysis, trembling, giddiness, colic, and sciatica. in time of plague too, and on travels, it is said to be a powerful aid.
