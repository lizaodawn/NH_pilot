in the third place must come the observation of the stars. these are sometimes seen to move to and fro, and this is immediately followed by wind in the quarter in which they have given this presage. when at the periodic points that we have set out the whole sky is equally brilliant, it will afford a fine and cold autumn. if spring and summer do not pass without a chilly period, they will cause a fine and misty autumn, with less wind. fine weather in autumn makes a windy winter. when the brightness of the stars becomes suddenly obscured, and that not by cloud or mist, rain or heavy storms are threatened. if several shooting stars are seen, they will announce winds from the quarters in the direction of which they travel, making a white track, steady winds if the stars twinkle, but if this occurs in several parts of the sky, shifting winds and blowing from all quarters. if one of the planets is enclosed by a circle, it means rain. in the constellation of the crab there are two small stars called the little asses, with a small gap between them containing a little nebula called the manger; when this nebula ceases to be visible in fine weather, a fierce storm follows; but if the northern one of the two stars is obscured by mist, there is a southerly gale, and if the southern one, a gale from the north. a double rainbow foretells rain, or coming after rain, fine weather, but this is not so certain; a ring of clouds round certain stars is a sign of rain.
