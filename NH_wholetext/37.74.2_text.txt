but there is no end to the names given to precious stones, and i have no intention of listing them in full, innumerable as they are, thanks to the wanton imagination of the greeks. now that i have mentioned the precious stones, and also some, indeed, that are common, i must be content with having given emphasis to the rarer varieties that deserve notice. one point only should be remembered, that, according to the different marks and excrescences that appear on the surface of stones, and according to the varied tracks and colours of the bands that traverse them, names are often altered when the material is commonly the same.
