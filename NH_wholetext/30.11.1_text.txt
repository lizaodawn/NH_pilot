i find that a heavy cold clears up if the sufferer kisses a mule's muzzle. pain in the uvula and in the throat is relieved by the dung, dried in shade, of lambs that have not yet eaten grass, uvula pain by applying the juice of a snail transfixed by a needle, so that the snail itself may be hung up in the smoke, and by the ash of swallows with honey. this also gives relief to affections of the tonsils. gargling with ewe's milk is a help to tonsils and throat, as is a multipede beaten up, gargling with pigeon's dung and raisin wine, and also an external application of it with dried fig and soda. sore throat and a running cold are relieved by snails — they should be boiled unwashed and with only the earth taken off crushed and given to drink in raisin wine; some hold that the snails of astypalaea are the most efficacious — by their ash, and also by rubbing with a cricket or if anybody touches the tonsils with hands that have crushed a cricket.
