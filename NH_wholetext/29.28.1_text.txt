the stelio is said in its turn to be such a great enemy to scorpions that the mere sight of one strikes them with panic, and torpor with cold sweat. accordingly they let it rot in oil and so smear on scorpion wounds. some boil down that oil with litharge to make a sort of ointment which they thus apply. this lizard the greeks call colotes, ascalabotes, or, galeotes. this kind is not found in italy, for it is covered with spots, has a shrill cry, and feeds on spiders, all which characteristics are lacking in our stelios.
