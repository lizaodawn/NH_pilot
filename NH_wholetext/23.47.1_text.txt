oil of balsam is by far the most valuable of all oils, as i have said in my account of unguents. it is efficacious for all snake bites, improves very much clearness of vision, disperses films over the eves, and also eases difficulty of breathing and all kinds of gatherings and indurations. it prevents thickening of the blood and cleanses sores, being very beneficial for ear troubles, headache, palsy, convulsions and ruptures. taken in milk it is an antidote to aconite, and rubbing the body with it reduces fevers that are accompanied by shivering. it must, however, be used in moderation, since it burns the flesh and aggravates complaints if there be any excess.
