sorrel (lapathum) has similar properties. there is also a wild kind called by some oxalis, by our people rumex and by others gelding sorrel. it has a taste very like that of the cultivated kind, pointed leaves, the colour of white beet and a very small root, being when mixed with axle-grease very efficacious for scrofula. there is also another kind, generally called pointed sorrel, even more like the cultivated kind, but with a leaf more pointed and redder, growing only in marshy localities. there are some who speak of a water sorrel, growing in water, and yet another, horse sorrel, larger, paler and more compact than the cultivated kind. the wild sorrels heal the stings of scorpions and protect from stings those who carry them on their persons. the root, boiled down in vinegar, is good for the teeth, if the juice be used as a mouth wash, while to drink the same is good for jaundice. the seed cures inveterate stomach troubles. the root of horse sorrel, in particular, brings away scabrous nails; its seed taken in wine in doses of two drachmae cures dysentery. the seed of pointed sorret washed in rainwater, with the addition of a piece of gum arabic, of the size of a lentil, is good for spitting of blood. most excellent lozenges are made from the leaves and root, with the addition of soda and a little frankincense. when wanted for use they are steeped in vinegar.
