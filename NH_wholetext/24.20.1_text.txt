the ground-pine, the latin name of which is abiga, because it causes abortion, and to some known as 'earth-incense,' has branches a cubit in length, with the flowers and the smell of the pine. a second species is shorter and bent, with leaves like those of ?aizollm. a third variety has the same smell, and therefore also the same name; it is rather small, with a stem as thick as a finger, and with rough, slender, pale leaves, growing on rocky soils. all three are plants, not trees, but should be considered here because their names are derived from that of the pine. they are good for the stings of scorpions, and also for the liver when applied with dates or quinces, as is a decoction of them with barley meal for the kidneys and bladder. decoctions of them in water are taken also for jaundice and for strangury. the last mentioned kind mixed with honey counteracts the poison of serpents, and in this form too purges the uterus when used as a pessary. taken as drink it draws away extravasated blood. rubbing with it promotes perspiration, and it is particularly good for the kidneys. it is also made up into pills with figs for dropsy; these purge the bowels. in doses of one victoriatus by weight in wine it ends lumbago, and also coughs if taken in good time. a decoction in vinegar taken as a drink is said to expel at once the dead foetus.
