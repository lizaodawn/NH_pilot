there follows the method of growing vines on a tree, which was condemned in a remarkable way by saserna the elder and by his son, but highly spoken of by scrofa â€” these are the oldest writers on agriculture after cato, and are very great authorities; and even scrofa only allows it in italy, although so long a period of time gives the verdict that high-class wines can only be produced from vines on trees, and that even so the choicer wines are made from the grapes at the top of the trees, while those lowest down give a large quantity: so beneficial is the effect of height. it is on this principle also that trees are selected: first of all the elm (excepting the atinian variety because it has too many leaves), then the black poplar, for the same reason, it having less dense foliage; also the ash and the fig are not despised by most growers, and even the olive if it has not shady branches. the planting and cultivation of these trees has been abundantly treated. it is prohibited to touch them with the pruning-knife before they are three years old; alternate branches are kept, they are pruned every other year, and in their sixth year they are wedded to the vines. italy north of the po beside the trees mentioned above plants its vineyards with cornel, guelder rose, lime, maple, rowan, hornbeam, and oak, but the venezia uses willow because of the dampness of the soil. also the elm is lopped of its top and has its middle branches spread out on three levels, no tree as a rule being left more than twenty feet high. on hills and in dry lands the stages of the elms are spread out at a height of eight feet, and on plains and in damp localities at twelve feet.
