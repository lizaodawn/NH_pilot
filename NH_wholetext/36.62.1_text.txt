open-air flooring was an invention of the greeks, who roof their houses in this way, an easy method to use in regions with a warm climate, but unreliable wherever there is heavy rainfall and frost. it is essential that two sets of joists should be laid across each other, and that their ends should be nailed down to avoid warping. to fresh rubble should be added a third of its weight in pounded potsherds; and then the rubble, mixed with two-fifths of its weight in lime, should be rammed down to a thickness of one foot. after this, a final coat 4 1/2 inches thick must be applied to the rubble and large square stones not less than 1 1/2 inches thick laid on it. a fall of 1 1/2 inches in 10 feet should be maintained and the surface carefully polished with grindstones. it is considered impracticable to lay the wood floor with oak planks, because they warp; and, furthermore, it is thought advisable to spread a layer of fern or straw below the rubble so that the worst effects of the quicklime may not reach the planks. it is essential also to lay a foundation of round pebbles under the rubble. tiled floors with a herring-bone pattern are constructed in a similar fashion.
