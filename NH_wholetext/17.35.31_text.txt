the trees for training vines on require the ground to be ploughed as deep as possible, although the system of growing corn there does not need this. it is not customary for them to be trimmed of leaves, and this economizes labour. they are pruned together with the vine, light being let through the density of branches that are superfluous and consume nutriment. we have given the rule against leaving lopped ends facing north or south, and it is better not to let them face west either, as wounds facing in those directions too suffer for a long time and heal with difficulty, because of undergoing excessive cold or heat; there is not the same freedom as in the ease of the vine, since trees have fixed aspects, but it is easier to hide away the wounds of a vine and twist them in any direction you like. in pruning trees cup-like hollows should be made with a mouth sloping downwards, to prevent water from lodging in them.
