contemporaries of euphranor were cydias, for whose picture of the argonauts the orator hortensius [114-50 bc] paid 144,000 sesterces, and made a shrine for its reception at his villa at tusculum. euphranor's pupil was antidotus. works by the latter are a combatant with a shield at athens and a wrestler and a trumpeter which has been exceptionally praised. antidotus himself was more careful in his work than prolific, and severe in his use of colours; his chief distinction was being the teacher of the athenian nicias, who was an extremely careful painter of female portraits. nicias kept a strict watch on light and shade, and took the greatest pains to make his paintings stand out from the panels. works of his are: a nemea, brought to rome from asia by silanus and deposited in the senate-house as we have said, and also the father liber or dionysus in the shrine of concord, a hyacinthus with which caesar augustus was so delighted that when he took alexandria he brought it back with him — and consequently tiberius caesar dedicated this picture in the temple of augustus — and a danae; while at ephesus there is the tomb of a megabyzus or priest of diana of ephesus, and at athens there is a necyomantea of homer. the last the artist refused to sell to king attalus for 60 talents, and preferred to present it to his native place, as he was a wealthy man. he also executed some large pictures, among them a calypso, an io and an andromeda; and also the very fine alexander in pompey's portico and a seated calypso are assigned to him.
