thlaspi is of two kinds. one has narrow leaves, a finger in breadth and length, turned towards the ground, and divided at the tip. the stem is half a foot long, not without branches, and with seed enclosed in shield-like pods and shaped like a lentil, except that — hence comes the name — it is indented. the blossom is white, and the plant grows in lanes and in hedges. the seed has a sharp taste and brings away bile and phlegm by both vomit and stools. the measure of a dose is an acetabulum. injections are good for sciatica, if continued until they draw blood. it is also an emmenagogue but kills the foetus. the other thlaspi is called by some persicon napy; it has broad leaves and large roots, while the plant itself is useful to make an injection for sciatica. both kinds are good for affections of the groin. the picker is recommended to say that he is taking it as a remedy for the groin, all kinds of gatherings, and wounds. he should lift it with one hand.
