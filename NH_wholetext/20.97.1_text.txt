hemp at first grew in woods, with a darker and rougher leaf. its seed is said to make the genitals impotent. the juice from it drives out of the ears the worms and any other creature that has entered them, but at the cost of a headache; so potent is its nature that when poured into water it is said to make it coagulate. and so, drunk in their water, it regulates the bowels of beasts of burden. the root boiled in water eases cramped joints, gout too and similar violent pains. it is applied raw to burns, but is often changed before it gets dry.
