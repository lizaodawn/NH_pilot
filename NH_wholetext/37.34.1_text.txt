there are also many other kinds of green stones. a member of the commoner class is the prase. a second variety of this stone differs in respect of its blood-red spots, and a third, because it is sharply marked with three white streaks. preference, however is given to the 'chrysoprasus,' or 'golden prase,' which likewise reproduces the tint of a leek, although in this case the tint veers slightly from that of peridot towards gold. this stone, moreover, may be large enough to be made even into small cups, and it is very commonly cut into cylinders.
