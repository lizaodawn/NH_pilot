in the same gulf is the island of tyros, which is covered with forests in the part facing east, where it also is flooded by the sea at high tide. each of the trees is the size of a fig-tree; they have a flower with an indescribably sweet scent and the fruit resembles a lupine, and is so prickly that no animal can touch it. on a more elevated plateau in the same island there are trees that bear wool, but in a different manner to those of the chinese as the leaves of these trees have no growth on them, and might be thought to be vine-leaves were it not that they are smaller; but they bear gourds of the size of a quince, which when they ripen burst open and disclose balls of down from which an expensive linen for clothing is made.
