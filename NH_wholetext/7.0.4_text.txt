his earliest promise of strength and first grant of time makes him like a four-footed animal. when does man begin to walk? when to speak? when is his mouth firm enough to take food? how long does his skull throb, a mark of his being the weakest among all animals? then his diseases, and all the cures contrived against his ills — these cures also subsequently defeated by new disorders! and the fact that all other creatures are aware of their own nature, some using speed, others swift flight, others swimming, whereas man alone knows nothing save by education — neither how to speak nor how to walk nor who to eat; in short the only thing he can do by natural instinct is to weep! consequently there have been many who believed that it were best not to be born, or to be put away as soon as possible. on man alone of living creatures is bestowed grief, on him alone luxury, and that in countless forms and reaching every separate part of his frame; he alone has ambition, avarice, immeasurable appetite for life, superstition, anxiety about burial and even about what will happen after he is no more. no creature's life is more precarious, none has a greater lust for all enjoyments, a more confused timidity, a fiercer rage. in fine, all other living creatures pass their time worthily among their own species: we see them herd together and stand firm against other kinds of animals — fierce lions do not fight among themselves, the serpent's bite attacks not serpents, even the monsters of the sea and the fishes are only cruel against different species; whereas to man, i vow, most of his evils come from his fellowman.
