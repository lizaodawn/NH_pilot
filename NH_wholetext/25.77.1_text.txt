likewise alisma, which some call damasonion, others lyron. the leaves would be like those of the plantaisi were they not narrower, more jagged, and bent downwards; in other respects the two are alike, even in their many veins. it has a single, slender stem, a cubit high and like a thyrsus at the top, with many close-set roots, slender like those of black hellebore, acrid, scented and juicy. it grows in watery places. the other kind of the same plant is found in woods; it is darker, and has larger leaves. the roots of both kinds are used for the poison of frogs and of the sea-hare, the dose being a drachma by weight taken in wine. cyclamen is another remedy for the poison of sea-hares. the bites of a mad dog also have a highly venomous character, a remedy for which will be found in cynorrhodum, of which i have spoken already, in the plantain, and for all bites of wild beasts in betony with old neat wine, taken as drink or applied locally.
