apicius, the most gluttonous gorger of all spendthrifts, established the view that the flamingo's tongue has a specially fine flavour. the francolin of ionia is extremely famous. normally it is vocal, though when caught it keeps silent. it was once considered one of the rare birds, but now it also occurs in gaul and spain. it is even caught in the neighbourhood of the alps, where also cormorants occur, a bird specially belonging to the balearic islands, as the chough, black with a yellow beak, and the particularly tasty willow-grouse belong to the alps. the latter gets its name of 'hare-foot' from its feet which are tufted like a hare's, though the rest of it is bright white; it is the size of a pigeon. outside that region it is not easy to keep it, as it does not grow tame in its habits and very quickly loses flesh. there is also another bird with the same name that only differs from quails in size, yellow-coloured, very acceptable for the table. egnatius calvinus, governor of the alps, has stated that also the ibis, which properly belongs to egypt, has been seen by him in that region.
