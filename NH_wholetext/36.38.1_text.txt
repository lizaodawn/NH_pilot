among the oldest authorities sotacus records five kinds of haematite, apart from the magnet. of these, the ethiopian receives from him the first place, a variety which is very useful for making up eye-salves and what the greeks call 'universal remedies,' as well as being effective for burns. the second is, according to him, known as man-tamer, black in colour and exceptionally heavy and hard: hence its name. it is found mainly in africa and attracts silver, copper and iron. the method of testing it is to rub it on a whetstone of slate, when, if genuine, it gives off a blood-red smear. it is a capital remedy for affections of the liver. the third kind, according to sotacus' reckoning, is the arabian, which is similarly hard and produces scarcely any smear on a hone used with water although on occasion there is a saffron-coloured smear. the fourth kind, so he says, is known as 'liver ore' in its natural state, and as 'ruddle ore' when it is roasted. it is useful for treating burns and more useful than ruddle for any purpose. the fifth is 'schistos,' and this when taken as a draught reduces piles. sotacus goes on to say that three drachms of any haematite pounded in oil should be swallowed on an empty stomach to counteract blood ailments. he also describes a 'schistos' different in kind from the haematite 'schistos' and known as anthracite. he states that it is a black stone found in africa and that, when it is rubbed on a water hone, what was originally the lower end produces a black mark and the other end a saffron-coloured one. according to him, it is useful by itself for making up eye-salves.
