aelius gallus, a member of the equestrian order, is the sole person who has hitherto carried the roman arms into these lands, for gaius caesar, the son of augustus, only had a distant view of arabia. in his expedition, gallus destroyed the following towns, the names of which are not given by the authors who had written before his time, negrana, nestum, nesca, masugum, caminacum, labecia, and mariva abovementioned, six miles in circumference, as also caripeta, the furthest point of his expedition. he brought back with him the following discoveries â€” that the nomades live upon milk and the flesh of wild beasts, and that the other nations, like the indians, extract a sort of wine from the palm-tree, and oil from sesame. he says that the most numerous of these tribes are the homeritae and the minaei, that their lands are fruitful in palms and shrubs, and that their chief wealth is centred in their flocks. we also learn from the same source that the cerbani and the agraei excel in arms, but more particularly the chatramotitae; that the territories of the carrei are the most extensive and most fertile; but that the sabaei are the richest of all in the great abundance of their spice-bearing groves, their mines of gold, their streams for irrigation, and their ample produce of honey and wax. of their perfumes we shall have to treat more at large in the book devoted to that subject. the arabs either wear the mitra, or else go with their hair unshorn, while the beard is shaved, except upon the upper lip: some tribes, however, leave even the beard unshaved. a singular thing too, one half of these almost innumerable tribes live by the pursuits of commerce, the other half by rapine: take them all in all, they are the richest nations in the world, seeing that such vast wealth flows in upon them from both the roman and the parthian empires; for they sell the produce of the sea or of their forests, while they purchase nothing whatever in return.
