the first bud of this fruit when it is beginning to blossom is called cytinus by the greeks; it has a wonderful feature, which has come under the notice of many investigators. if a person, after freeing himself from every kind of band - girdle, shoes, even his ring - plucks one of these buds with two fingers, the thumb and the fourth finger, of his left hand, brushes his eyes with it, lightly touching them, and then swallows it without its touching any tooth, he will suffer, it is said, no eye-trouble during the same year. these same buds, dried and pounded, reduce fleshy excrescences, healing gums and teeth, even if they be loose, by the use of a decoction of the juice. the little buds, just as they are except for pounding, are applied to spreading, purulent sores, also to inflamed eyes and for inflammation of the intestines, and for nearly all the affections for which pomegranate rinds are used. they neutralize the stings of scorpions.
