andrachle is almost always rendered into latin for the greeks by the word 'purslain,' although purslain is a herbaceous plant and its greek name is one letter different, andrachne: for the rest the andrachle is a forest tree, nor does it grow in level country. it resembles the arbutus, only it has a smaller leaf and is an evergreen; the bark, though not rough, might be supposed to have frozen round the tree, it has such a wretched appearance.
