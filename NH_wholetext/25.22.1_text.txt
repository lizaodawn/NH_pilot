black hellebore is a cure for paralysis, madness, dropsy without fever, chronic gout and diseases of the joints; it draws from the belly bile, phlegms and morbid fluids. for gently moving the bowels the maximum dose is one drachma; a moderate one is four oboli. some have mixed scammony also with it, but to add salt is safer. a larger dose given in sweet substances is dangerous; used as a fomentation it disperses films over the eyes. therefore some have also pounded it and made an eye salve. it matures and clears up scrofulous sores, suppurations and indurations; fistulas also if it be taken off on the third day. with copper scales and sandarach it removes warts. with barley meal and wine it is applied to the abdomen for dropsy. it cures phlegms in cattle and draught animals if a spray be passed across the ear and taken out at the same hour on the next day; with frankincense, wax and pitch, or with pisselaeon it cures itch in quadrupeds.
