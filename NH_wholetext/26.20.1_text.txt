ephedra, called by some anabasis, grows generally in wind-swept regions, climbs trees and hangs down from their branches. it has no leaves, but numerous rush-like, jointed tufts, and a pale root. for cough, asthma and colic it is given pounded in a dark-red, dry wine; and it may be made into a gruel, to which wine should be added. another remedy is gentian, thoroughly pounded after being steeped the day before, the dose being a denarius by weight in three cyathi of wine.
