there is no doubt that pearls are worn away by use, and that lack of care makes them change their colour. their whole value lies in their brilliance, size, roundness, smoothness and weight, qualities of such rarity that no two pearls are found that are exactly alike: this is doubtless the reason why roman luxury has given them the name of 'unique gems,' the word not existing in greece, and indeed among foreign races, who discovered this fact, the only name for them is margarita. there is also a great variety in their actual brilliance; it is brighter with those found in the red sea, whereas those found in the indian ocean resemble flakes of mica, though they excel others in size. the highest praise given to their colour is for them to be called alum-coloured. the longer ones also have a charm of their own. those that end in a wider circle, tapering lengthwise in the shape of perfume-caskets, are termed 'probes.' women glory in hanging these on their fingers and using two or three for a single-earring, and foreign names for this luxury occur, names invented by abandoned extravagance, inasmuch as when they have done this they call them 'castanets,' as if they enjoyed even the sound and the mere rattling together of the pearls; and now-a-days even poor people covet them - it is a common saying that a pearl is as good as a lackey for a lady when she walks abroad! and they even use them on their feet, and fix them not only to the laces of their sandals but all over their slippers. in fact, by this time they are not content with wearing pearls unless they tread on them, and actually walk on these unique gems!
