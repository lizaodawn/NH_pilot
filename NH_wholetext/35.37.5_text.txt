but among artists great fame has been confined to painters of pictures only a fact which shows the wisdom of early times to be the more worthy of respect, for they did not decorate walls, merely for owners of property, or houses, which would remain in one place and which could not be rescued from a fire. protogenes was content with a cottage in his little garden; apelles had no wall-frescoes in his house; it was not yet the fashion to colour the whole of the walls. with all these artists their art was on the alert for the benefit of cities, and a painter was the common property of the world.
