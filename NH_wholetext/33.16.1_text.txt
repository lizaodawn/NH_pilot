we too have done things to be deemed mythical by those who come after us. caesar, the future dictator, was the first person in the office of aedile to use nothing but silver for the appointments of the arena - it was at the funeral games presented in honour of his father; and this was the first occasion on which criminals made to fight with wild animals had all their equipment made of silver, a practice nowadays rivalled even in our municipal towns. gaius antonius gave plays on a silver stage, and so did lucius murena; and the emperor gaius caligula brought on a scaffolding is in the [ad. 37-41] circus which had on it 124,000 pounds weight of silver. his successor claudius when celebrating a triumph after the conquest of britain, advertised by placards [ad. 43] that among the gold coronets there was one having a weight of 7000 pounds contributed by hither spain and one of 9000 from gallia comata. his immediate successor nero covered the theatre of pompey with gold for one day's purpose, when he was to display it to tiridates king of armenia. yet how small was the theatre in comparison with nero's golden palace which goes all round the city!
