there are also several kinds of hare. in the alps there are white hares, which are believed to eat snow for their fodder in the winter months — at all events they turn a reddish colour every year when the snow melts — and in other ways the animal is a nurseling of the intolerable cold. the animals in spain called rabbits also belong to the genus hare; their fertility is beyond counting, and they bring famine to the balearic islands by ravaging the crops. their young cut out from the mother before birth or taken from the teat are considered a very great delicacy, served without being gutted; the name for them is laurer. it is an established fact that the peoples of the balearics petitioned the late lamented augustus for military assistance against the spread of these animals. the ferret is extremely popular for rabbit-hunting; they throw ferrets into the burrows with a number of exits that the rabbits tunnel in the ground (this is the derivation of their name cony) and so catch the rabbits when they are driven out to the surface. archelaus states that a hare is as many years old as it has folds in the bowel: these are certainly found to vary in number. the same authority says that the hare is a hermaphrodite and reproduces equally well without a male. nature has shown her benevolence in making harmless and edible breeds of animals prolific. the hare which is born to be all creatures' prey is the only animal beside the shaggy-footed rabbit that practises superfetation, rearing one leveret while at the same time carrying in the womb another clothed with hair and another bald and another still an embryo. also the experiment has been made of using the fur of the hare for making clothes, although it is not so soft to the touch as it is when on the animal's skin, and the garments soon come to pieces because of the shortness of the hair.
