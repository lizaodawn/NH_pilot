all sweet wine has less aroma; the thinner a wine is the more aroma it has. wines are of four colours, white, brown, blood-red and black. psithian and black psithian are kinds of raisin-wine with a peculiar flavour which is not that of wine; scybelites is a kind of must produced in galatia, and aluntium another, produced in sicily. siraion, by some called hepsema and in our country sapa, is a product of art, not of nature, made by boiling down must to a third of its quantity; must boiled down to only one-half is called defrutum. all these wines have been devised for adulterating with honey; but the wines previously mentioned are the product of the grape and of the soil. next after the raisin-wine of crete those of cilicia and of africa are held in esteem. raisin-wine is known to be made in italy and in the neighbouring provinces from the grape called by the greeks psithia and by us 'muscatel,' and also scripula, the grapes being left on the vine longer than usual to ripen in the sun, or else being ripened in boiling oil. some people make this wine from any sweet white grape that ripens early, drying them in the sun till little more than half their weight remains, and then they beat them and gently press out the juice. afterwards they add to the skins the same quantity of well-water as they have pressed out juice, so as also to make raisin-wine of second quality. the more careful makers, after drying the bunches in the same manner, pick off the berries and soak them without their stalks in wine of good quality till they swell, and then press them â€” and this kind of wine is the most highly praised of any; and then they repeat the process, adding more water, and make a wine of second quality.
