the swiftest of all animals, not only those of the sea, is the dolphin; it is swifter than a bird and darts faster than a javelin, and were not its mouth much below its snout, almost in the middle of its belly, not a single fish would escape its speed. but nature's foresight contributes delay, because they cannot seize their prey except by turning over on their backs. this fact especially shows their speed; for when spurred by hunger they have chased a fleeing fish into the lowest depths and have held their breath too long, they shoot up like arrows from a bow in order to breathe again, and leap out of the water with such force that they often fly over a ship's sails. they usually roam about in couples, husband and wife; they bear cubs after nine months, in the summer season, occasionally even twins. they suckle their young, as do whales, and even carry them about while weak from infancy; indeed they accompany them for a long time even when grown up, so great is their affection for their offspring. they grow up quickly, and are believed to reach their full size in 10 years. they live as much as 30 years, as has been ascertained by amputating the tail of a specimen for an experiment. they are in retirement for 30 days about the rising of the dog-star and hide themselves in an unknown manner, which is the more surprising in view of the fact that they cannot breathe under water. they have a habit of sallying out on to the land for an unascertained reason, and they do not die at once after touching earth - in fact they die much more quickly if the gullet is closed up. the dolphin's tongue, unlike the usual structure of aquatic animals, is mobile, and is short and broad, not unlike a pig's tongue. for a voice they have a moan like that of a human being; their back is arched, and their snout turned up, owing to which all of them in a surprising manner answer to the name of 'snubnose' and like it better than any other.
