the greatest flyers are the species resembling swallows called (because they lack the use of feet) and by others 'cypseli.' they build their nests on crags. these are the birds seen all over the sea, and ships never go away from land on so long or so unbroken a course that they do not have apodes flying round them. all the other kinds alight and perch, but these never rest except on the nest: they either hover or lie on a surface.
