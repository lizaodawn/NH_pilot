the chamaedrys ('ground oak') is a plant whose latin name is trixago. some have called it chamaerops, and others the trojan plant. it has leaves of the same size as mint leaves, coloured and indented as are those of the oak. some have called it 'saw-shaped,' saying that it gave rise to the invention of the saw; its blossom is almost purple. it is cropped in rocky localities and is full of juice, being a very efficacious remedy, either by the mouth or as an ointment, for the poison of serpents, and also for disordered stomach, chronic cough, phlegm collected in the throat, ruptures, sprains and pain in the side. it reduces the spleen, promotes menstruation, and is diuretic, being for this reason efficacious in incipient dropsy, a handful of its sprays being boiled down to one-third in a sextarius and a half of water. it is ground in water to make lozenges for the purposes mentioned above. with honey it also heals abscesses and chronic sores, even when foul. there is also made from it a wine, which is useful for troubles of the chest. the juice of the leaves with oil clears away dimness of vision; for the spleen it is taken in vinegar. used also as embrocation it is warming.
