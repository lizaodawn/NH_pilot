at rome, indeed, the great number of works of art and again their consequent effacement from our memory, and, even more, the multitude of official functions and business activities must, after ally deter anyone from serious study, since the appreciation involved needs leisure and deep silence in our surroundings. hence we do not know the maker even of the venus dedicated by the emperor vespasian [ad. 69-79] in the precincts of his temple of peace, although it deserves to rank with the old masters. equally there is doubt as to whether the dying children of niobe in the temple of the sosian apollo was the work of scopas or of praxiteles. similarly, we cannot tell which of the two carved the father janus which was dedicated in its rightful temple by augustus after being brought here from egypt; and now a covering of gilt has hidden its secret still more. equally, there is a controversy about the cupid holding a thunderbolt in the hall of octavia. only one thing is stated with conviction, namely that the figure is that of alcibiades the most handsome youth of that time. in the same salon there are many pleasing works of which the authors are unknown, for example, the four satyrs, of whom one is carrying on his shoulders father liber dressed in a robe and another is likewise carrying ariadne, while a third stops a child crying and a fourth gives a drink to another child out of a mixing-bowl; and the two breezes, who are spreading their cloaks like sails. there is just as much dispute as to the makers of the olympus and pan and the chiron with achilles in the voting enclosure, even though their fame pronounces them to be so valuable that their keepers must answer for their safety with their lives.
