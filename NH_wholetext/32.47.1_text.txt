superfluous hair is removed by blood, gall, and liver of the tunny, whether fresh or preserved, by the liver too when beaten up, mixed with cedar oil, and stored in a leaden box. in this way slave boys were prepared for market by salpe the midwife. the same property is found in the pulmo marinus, in the blood and gall of the sea hare, or this hare itself killed in oil. there is also used the ash of the crab or of the sea scolopendra with oil, the sea anemone beaten up in squill vinegar, or the brain of the torpedo applied with alum on the sixteenth day of the moon. the blood-like matter (sanies) given out by the small frog, that we have spoken of in the treatment of the eyes, is a most efficacious depilatory if applied fresh; and so is the frog itself, dried and pounded up, and then boiled down to one third in three heminae, or boiled down in oil in brazen vessels. others make a depilatory out of fifteen frogs treated with the same proportions of liquid, as we mentioned when treating of the eyes. leeches also, roasted in an earthen vessel and applied with vinegar, have the same effect in extracting hair. the fumes that come from those burning the leeches kill bugs. there are also found those who have used for several days as a depilatory rubbing with beaver oil and honey. before using however any depilatory the hairs must first be pulled out.
