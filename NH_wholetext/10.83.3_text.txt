all animals are less fertile the larger they are in bulk. elephants, camels and horses produce off-spring one at a time, but the thistle-finch, the smallest of birds, twelve at a time. those that produce most young bear them most quickly; the larger the animal, the longer it takes to be shaped in the womb; the more long-lived ones are cared for longer by the mother. also animals are not of an age suitable for procreation while they are still growing. solid-hoofed animals bear one child at a time, those with cloven hooves also bear two, but those whose feet are divided into separate toes also produce a larger number. but whereas all those above bear their offspring fully formed, these produce them unfinished - in this class being lionesses and bears; and a fox bears its young in an even more unfinished state than the species above-mentioned, and it is rare to see one in the act of giving birth. afterwards all these species warm their offspring and shape them by licking them. their litters number four at the most. dogs, wolves, panthers and jackals bear their young blind.
