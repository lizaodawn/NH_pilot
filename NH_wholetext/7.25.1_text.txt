the most outstanding instance of innate mental vigour i take to be the dictator caesar; and i am not now thinking of valour and resolution, nor of a loftiness embracing all the contents of the firmament of heaven, but of native vigour and quickness winged as it were with fire. we are told that he used to write or read and dictate or listen simultaneously, and to dictate to his secretaries four letters at once on his important affairs - or, if otherwise unoccupied, seven letters at once. he also fought fifty pitched battles, and alone beat the record of marcus marcellus who fought thirty-nine - for i would not myself count it to his glory that in addition to conquering his fellow-citizens he killed in his battles 1,192,000 human beings, a prodigious even if unavoidable wrong indicted on the human race, as he himself confessed it to be by not publishing the casualties of the civil wars.
