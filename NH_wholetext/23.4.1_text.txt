how omphacium is made, just before the grape begins to mature, i have already described in my section on unguents; will now notice its medicinal properties. it also cures sores in a moist part of the body, such as the mouth, tonsils or genitals. it is very helpful for clearness of vision and is good for scabrous eyelids, sores in the corners of the eyes, films on the eyes, running sores in any part of the body, flabby scars, and bones with a slimy pus on them. its strength can be modified by adding honey or raisin wine. omphacium is also good for dysentery, spitting of blood, and quinsy.
