all animals start walking with the right foot and lie down on the left side. whereas the other animals walk as they like, only the lion and the camel pace with one foot after the other, that is with the left foot not passing but following the right foot. human beings have the largest feet; the females of all species have more slender feet; man alone has calves and legs that are fleshy. we find it stated in the authorities that a certain person in egypt had no calves. man alone has an arched sole to the foot (with some exceptions â€” a deformity that is the origin of the surnames flatfoot, broadfoot, splayfoot, swellfoot, just as from the legs come the names knock-knee, bowleg, bandyleg, deformities that also occur in animals). some animals without horns have solid hooves: consequently in place of horns a kick of the hoof is their weapon. and the same animals have no pastern-bone, but those with cloven hooves have one. pastern-bones are also lacking in animals having toes, and no animal has them in the forefeet. the camel's pastern-bones resemble those of the ox but are a little smaller; for the camel's foot is divided in two by a very small cleft, and is fleshy at the tread like a bear's, for which reason a camel's feet are liable to split on too long a journey without shoeing.
