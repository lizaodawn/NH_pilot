judaea: beyond idumaea and samaria, judaea extends far and wide. that part of it which joins up to syria is called galilaea, while that which is nearest to arabia and egypt bears the name of peraea. this last is thickly covered with rugged mountains, and is separated from the rest of judaea by the river jordanes. the remaining part of judaea is divided into ten toparchies, which we will mention in the following order: that of hiericus, covered with groves of palm-trees, and watered by numerous springs, and those of emmaus, lydda, joppe, acrabatena, gophna, thamna, bethleptephene, orina, in which formerly stood hierosolyma, by far the most famous city, not of judaea only, but of the east, and herodium, with a celebrated town of the same name.
