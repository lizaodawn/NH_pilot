some trees on the other hand have the property of not degenerating at all in whatever way they are propagated, for instance cypresses, the palm and laurels - for the laurel also can be propagated in a variety of ways. we have stated the various kinds of laurel. of these the augusta, the berry laurel and the laurustinus are propagated in a similar manner: their berries are picked in january, after they have been dried by a spell of north-east wind, and are spread out separately, so as not to ferment by lying in a heap; afterwards some people treat them with dung in preparation for sowing and soak them with urine, but others put them in running water in a wicker basket, and stamp on them till the skin is washed away, which otherwise is attacked by stagnant moisture and does not allow them to bear. they are planted in a freshly dug trench a hand's breadth deep, about twenty in a cluster; this is done in march. these laurels can also be propagated by layering, but the laurel worn in triumphal processions can only be grown from a cutting. myrtles of all varieties are grown from berries in campania, but at rome by layering. democritus tells us that the taranto myrtle is also grown in another way: the berries are taken, and after being crushed lightly so as not to break the pips are mixed into a paste with water and this is pounded up and smeared on a rope, which is then put in the ground; from this, he says, will grow up a remarkably thick hedge, from which slips can be transplanted. they also grow brambles for hedges in the same way, by smearing a rope of rushes with blackberries. in case of scarcity, laurel and myrtle seeds are ready for transfer at the end of three years.
