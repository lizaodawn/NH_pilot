nearly all kitchen-garden plants have only a single root, for instance radish, beet, parsley mallow. sorrel has the largest root, going as far as a yard and a half into the ground (the root of the wild sorrel is smaller), and its root is full of sap, and lives a long time even after being dug up. in some of these plants, however, for instance parsley and mallow, the root is fibrous, in some, for instance basil, woody, in others fleshy, as in beet or still more in saffron, and with some, for instance radish and turnip, the roots consist of rind and flesh, and the roots of some, for instance hay-grass, are jointed. those which have not a straight root support themselves immediately with a great many hairy fibres, for instance orage and blite; but squill and the bulbs and onion and garlic only throw out straight roots. some of the plants that grow self-sown have more root than leaf, for instance partridge-plant and crocus. wild thyme, southernwood, turnips, radishes, mint and rue blossom all in a bunch. all other plants shed their blossom all at once as soon as they have begun to do so, but basil does so gradually, starting from the bottom, and consequently it flowers for a very long time. this also happens in the case of the heliotrope. some plants have a white flower, others yellow and others purple. wild marjoram and elecampane shed their leaves from the top down, and so sometimes does rue when it has been damaged by an accident. the onion and the leek have especially hollow leaves.
