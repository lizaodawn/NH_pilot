the third region of italy: at the silarus begins the third region of italy, consisting of the territory of lucania and bruttium; here too there have been no few changes of the population. these districts have been possessed by the pelasgi, the oenotrii, the itali, the morgetes, the siculi, and more especially by people who emigrated from greece, and, last of all, by the leucani, a people sprung from the samnites, who took possession under the command of lucius. we find here the town of paestum, which received from the greeks the name of posidonia, the gulf of paestum, the town of elea, now known as velia, and the promontory of palinurum, a point at which the land falls inwards and forms a bay, the distance across which to the pillar of rhegium is 100 miles. next after palinurum comes the river melpes, then the town of buxentum, called in graecia pyxus, and the river laus; there was formerly a town also of the same name.
