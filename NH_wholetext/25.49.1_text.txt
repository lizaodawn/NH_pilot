servilius democrates also, one of our foremost physicians, recently discovered the value of what he called hiberis, although in the verses he wrote on its discovery he assigned this to an imaginary person. it grows chiefly near old monuments, ruins, and the waste land beside highways. it is an evergreen, with leaves like cress, a stem a cubit high, and with seed that can scarcely be seen. the root has the smell of cress. it is used more efficaciously in summer, and only when freshly gathered will it serve. there is difficulty in pounding it. for sciatica and all complaints of the joints it is, with a little axle-grease added, very beneficial. the longest application is four hours for men and half as long for women; then the patient must go down to the hot water of the baths, and afterwards must be rubbed all over the body with wine and oil. the treatment should be repeated at intervals of twenty days, if any hint of pain persists. this treatment cures all hidden fluxes. the application is not made when inflammation is acute, but only when it has gone down.
