i am of opinion that the assyrians have always had writing, but others, e.g. gellius, hold that it was invented in egypt by mercury, while others think it was discovered in syria; both schools of thought believe that cadmus imported an alphabet of 16 letters into greece from phoenicia and that to these palamedes at the time of the trojan war added the four characters ζψφχ, and after him simonides the lyric poet added another four υξωθy, all representing sounds recognized also in the roman alphabet. aristotle holds that the primitive alphabet contained 18 letters, and that ψ and z were added by epicharmus more probably than palamedes. anticlides records that a person named menos invented the alphabet in egypt 15,000 years before phoroneus, the most ancient king of greece, and he attempts to prove this by the monuments. on the other side epigenes, an authority of the first rank, teaches that the babylonians had astronomical observations for 730,000 years inscribed on baked bricks; and those who give the shortest period, berosus and critodemus, make it 490,000 years; from which it appears that the alphabet has been in use from very ancient times. it was brought to latium by the pelasgi.
