as a mark of honour to the gods at sacrifices no other means has been devised but to gild the horns of the victims to be immolated, at all events of full-grown animals. but in military service also this form of luxury has grown to such dimensions that we find a letter of marcus brutus sent from the plains of philippi expressing his indignation at the brooches made of gold that were worn by the tribunes. really i must protest! why, even you, brutus, did not mention the gold worn on their feet by women, and we accuse of crime the man who first conferred dignity on gold by using gold rings! let even men nowadays wear gold bracelets — called 'dardania' because the fashion came from the dardani — the celtic name for them is 'viriolae' and the celtiberian 'viriae'; let women have gold in their bracelets and covering their fingers and on their neck, ears and tresses, let gold chains run at random round their waists; and let little bags of pearls hang invisible suspended by gold chains from their lady owners' neck, so that even in their sleep they may retain the consciousness of possessing gems: but are even their feet to be shod with gold, and shall gold create this female order of knighthood, intermediate between the matron's robe and the common people? much more becomingly do we men bestow this on our page-boys, and the wealthy show these lads make has quite transformed the public baths! but nowadays even men are beginning to wear on their fingers a representation of harpocrates and figures of egyptian deities. in the time of the emperor claudius there was also [ad 41-54] another unusual distinction, belonging to those whose rights of free access to the presence had given them the privilege of wearing a gold likeness of the emperor on a ring, this affording a great opportunity for informations; but all of this was however entirely abolished by the opportune rise to power of the emperor vespasian, by making the [ad 69-79] emperor equally accessible to all. let this suffice for a discussion of the subject of gold rings and their employment.
