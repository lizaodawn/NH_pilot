the linden tree is good for practically the same purposes as the wild olive, but its action is milder. only its leaves, however, are used both for babies' sores and for those in the mouth; they may be chewed or a decoction may be made of them; they are diuretic. applied locally they check menstruation; taken in drink they draw off extravasated blood.
