water also gives signs. if when the sea is calm the water in a harbour sways about or makes a splashing noise of its own, it foretells wind, and if it does so in winter, rain as well; if the coasts and shores re-echo during a calm, they foretell a severe storm, as also do noises from the sea itself in a calm, or scattered flakes of foam, or bubbles on the water. jellyfish on the surface of the sea portend several days' storm. often also the sea swells in silence, and blown up in unusually high waves confesses that the winds are now inside it.
