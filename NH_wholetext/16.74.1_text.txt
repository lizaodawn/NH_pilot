the proper time for felling trees that are to be stripped of their bark, for instance well-turned trees that are to be used for temples and other purposes requiring round pillars, is when they bud - at other times the bark is impossible to detach and decay is setting in under it and the timber is turning black; but the time for cutting beams and logs to be cleared of their bark by the axe is between midwinter and the period of westerly wind, or if we should be obliged to do it sooner, at the setting of areturus and, before that, at the setting of the lyre - on the earliest calculation at midsummer: the dates of these constellations will be given in the proper place. it is commonly thought sufficient to take care that no tree is felled to be rough-hewn before it has born its fruit. the hard oak if cut in spring is liable to woodworm; if cut at midwinter it neither rots nor warps, but otherwise it is even liable to twist and to split, and this happens in the case of the cork-tree even if felled at the proper time. it is also of enormous importance to take account of the moon, and people recommend that trees should be felled only between the twentieth and thirtieth days of the month. it is universally agreed, however, that the most advantageous time for felling timber is when the moon is in conjunction with the sun, the date which some call the interlunar day and others the day of the moon's silence. at all events those were the limits fixed in advance by the emperor tiberius for felling larches in raetia for the reconstruction of the deck of the naval sham fight when it had been burnt down. some people say that the moon ought to be in conjunction and below the horizon, a thing that can only happen in the night.
