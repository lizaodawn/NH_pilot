for my own part i am also influenced by the agreement of the nations. the greeks have designated the world by a word that means 'ornament,' and we have given it the name of mundus because of its perfect finish and grace! as for our word caelum, it undoubtedly has the signification 'engraved,' as is explained by marcus varro. further assistance is contributed by its orderly structure, the circle called the zodiac being marked out into the likenesses of twelve animals; and also by the uniform regularity in so many centuries of the sun's progress through these signs.
