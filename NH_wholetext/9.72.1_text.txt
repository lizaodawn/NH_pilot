nor are there wanting dire poisons, as in the sea-hare which in the indian ocean infects even by its touch, immediately causing vomiting and laxity of the stomach, and in our own seas the shapeless lump resembling a hare in colour only, whereas the indian variety is also like a hare in size and in fur, only its fur is harder; and there it is never taken alive. an equally pestiferous creature is the weaver, which wounds with the sharp point of its dorsal fin. but there is nothing in the world more execrable than the sting projecting above the tail of the stingray which our people call the parsnip-fish; it is five inches long, and kills trees when driven into the root, and penetrates armour like a missile, with the force of steel and with deadly poison.
