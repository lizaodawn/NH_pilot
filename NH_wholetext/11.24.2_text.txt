the forest variety of hornets live in hollow trees, hibernating in winter like the rest of insects; they do not live beyond the age of two. their sting is rarely not followed by fever. some authorities state that twenty-seven a hornet-stings will kill a human being. another kind that seems less fierce has two classes - workers, smaller in size, which die in winter, and mothers, which last two years: these are not fierce at all. they make nests in spring, usually with four entrances, in which to breed the workers. when these have been reared, they then make other larger nests, in which they may now produce those who are to be mothers. then the workers begin to function, and feed the mothers. the mothers are of a wider shape, and it is doubtful whether they possess stings, because they do not come out. these also have their drones. some people hold the view that all these insects lose their stings towards winter. neither the hornet nor the wasp kind have kings, nor do they swarm, but their numbers are continually renewed by offspring.
