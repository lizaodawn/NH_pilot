since certain authorities, as i have said, have given to the root of celtic valerian the name of rustic nard, i will now add the medicinal uses of gallic nard also, which i mentioned when dealing with foreign trees, postponing fuller treatment to the present occasion. so for serpent bites it is useful in doses of two drachmae taken in wine, for flatulence of the colon in either water or wine, for troubles of the liver and kidneys, excessive bile, and dropsy, either by itself or with wormwood. it checks excessive attacks of menstruation.
