ploughshares are of several kinds. the coulter is the name for the part fixed in front of the share-beam, cutting the earth before it is broken up and marking out the tracks for the future furrows with incisions which the share sloping backward is to bite out in the process of ploughing. another kind is the ordinary share consisting of a lever with a pointed beak, and a third kind used in easy soil does not present an edge along the whole of the share-beam but only has a small spike at the extremity. in a fourth kind of plough this spike is broader and sharper, ending off in a point, and using the same blade both to cleave the soil and with the sharp edge of the sides to cut the roots of the weeds. an invention was made not long ago in the grisons fitting a plough of this sort with two small wheels - the name in the vernacular for this kind of plough is plaumorati; the share has the shape of a spade. this method is only used for sowing in cultivated land and land that is nearly fallow; the breadth of the share turns the turves over; men at once scatter the seed on it and draw toothed harrows over the furrows. fields that have been sown in this way do not need hoeing, but this method of ploughing requires teams of two or three pairs of oxen. it is a fair estimate for forty acres of easy soil and thirty of difficult to be rated as a year's work for one team of oxen.
