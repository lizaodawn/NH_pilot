she preserved the senator marcus fidustius for 36 years after his proscription by sulla, but only to proscribe him a second time: he survived sulla, but he lived to see antony, and it is known that antony proscribed him for no other reason than that he had been proscribed before! it is true she willed that publius ventidius should alone win a triumph from the parthians, but she also in his boyhood led him captive in gnaeus pompeius's triumph after asculum — albeit masurius states that he was led in triumph twice, and cicero that he was a mule-driver for an army bakery, and many authorities say that in his youth he supported his poverty by foot-slogging in the ranks! also the elder cornelius balbus was consul, but he was impeached and handed over to a court of justice to decide as to his legal liability to a flogging — he being the first foreigner and actual native of the atlantic coast to have held an honour refused by our ancestors even to latium. lucius fulvius also is one of the notable examples, having been consul of the tusculans at the time of their revolt and after coming over having been at once honoured with the same office by the roman nation: he is the only man who ever in the same year in which he had been rome's enemy won a triumph from the people whose consul he had been. lucius sulla is the sole human being hitherto who has assumed the surname fortunate, in fact achieving the title by civil bloodshed and by making war upon his country. and what tokens of good fortune were his motive? his success in exiling and slaughtering so many thousands of his fellow-countrymen?
