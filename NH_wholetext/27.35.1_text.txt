catanance, thessalian plant, it would be a waste of time for me to describe, since it is used only for love-potions. one thing it is quite pertinent to say in order to show up the fraud of sorcery: the plant was chosen for this purpose by soothsayers because as it withers it crumples up into the shape of the claws of a dead kite. for the same reason i shall say nothing about cemos.
