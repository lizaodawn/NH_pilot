travellers' sundials are not the same for reference everywhere, because the shadows thrown by the sun as they alter alter the readings at every 300 or at farthest 500 stades. consequently in egypt at midday on the day of the equinox the shadow of the pin or 'gnomon' measures a little more than half the length of the gnomon itself, whereas in the city of rome the shadow is 1/9th shorter than the gnomon, at the town of ancona 1/35th longer, and in the district of italy called venezia the shadow is equal to the gnomon, at the same hours.
