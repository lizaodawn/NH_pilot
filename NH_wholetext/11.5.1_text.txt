in winter insects go into retirement for whence could they obtain strength to endure frost and snow and the blasts of the north wind? — all species alike, no doubt, but not for so long a period the ones that hide in our house-walls .and are warmed earlier than others are. in regard to bees, either seasons or else climates have changed, or previous writers have been mistaken. they go into retirement after the setting of the pleiades and remain in hiding till after their rise so not till the beginning of spring, as writers have said — and nobody in italy thinks about hives before the bean is in flower. they go out to their works and to their labours, and not a single day is lost in idleness when the weather grants permission. first they construct combs and mould wax, that is, construct their homes and cells, then produce offspring, and afterwards honey, wax from flowers, bee-glue from the droppings of the gum-producing trees — the sap, glue and resin of the willow, elm and reed. they first smear the whole interior of the hive itself with these as with a kind of stucco, and then with other bitterer juices as a protection against the greed of other small creatures, as they know that they are going to make something that may possibly be coveted; with the same materials they also build wider gateways round the structure.
