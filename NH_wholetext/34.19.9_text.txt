lysippus left three sons who were his pupils, the celebrated artists laippus, boedas and euthycrates, the last pre-eminent, although he copied the harmony rather than the elegance of his father, preferring to win favour in the severely correct more than in the agreeable style. accordingly his heracles, at delphi, and his alexander hunting, at thespiae, his group of thespiades, and his cavalry in action are works of extreme finish, and so are his statue of trophonius at the oracular shrine of that deity, a number of four-horse chariots, a horse with baskets and a pack of hounds. moreover tisicrates, another native of sikyon, was a pupil of euthycrates, but closer to the school of lysippus â€” indeed many of his statues cannot be distinguished from lysippus's work, for instance his old man of thebes, his king demetrius (poliorcetes), and his peucestes, the man who saved the life of alexander the great and so deserved the honour of this commemoration.
