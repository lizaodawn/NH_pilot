a certain kind of magpie is less celebrated, because it does not come from a distance, but it talks more articulately. these birds get fond of uttering particular words, and not only learn them but love them, and secretly ponder them with careful reflexion, not concealing their engrossment. it is an established fact that if the difficulty of a word beats them this causes their death, and that their memory fails them unless they hear the same word repeatedly, and when they are at a loss for a word they cheer up wonderfully if in the meantime they hear it spoken. their shape is unusual, though not beautiful: this bird has enough distinction in its power of imitating the human voice. but they say that none of them can go on learning except ones of the species that feeds on acorns, and among these those with five claws on the feet learn more easily, and not even they themselves except in the two first years of their life. all the birds in each kind that imitate human speech have exceptionally broad tongues, although this occurs in almost all species; claudius caesar's consort agrippina had a thrush that mimicked what people said, which was unprecedented. at the time when i was recording these cases, the young princes a had a starling and also nightingales that were actually trained to talk greek and latin, and moreover practised diligently and spoke new phrases every day, in still longer sentences. birds are taught to talk in private and where no other utterance can interrupt, with the trainer sitting by them to keep on repeating the words he wants retained, and coaxing them with morsels of food.
