the cause of the remaining facts that surprise us is found in the shape of the earth itself, which together with the waters also the same arguments prove to resemble a globe. for this is undoubtedly the cause why for us the stars of the northern region never set and their opposites of the southern region never rise, while on the contrary these northern stars are not visible to the antipodes, as the curve of the earth's globe bars our view of the tracts between. cave-dweller country [trogodytike, abyssinia/somaliland] and egypt which is adjacent to it do not see the great and little bear, and italy does not see canopus and the constellation called berenice's hair, also the one that in the reign of his late majesty augustus received the name of caesar's throne, constellations that are conspicuous there. and so clearly does the rising vault curve over that to observers at alexandria canopus appears to be elevated nearly a quarter of one sign above the earth, whereas from rhodes it seems practically to graze the earth itself, and on the black sea, where the north stars are at their highest, it is not visible at all. also canopus is hidden from rhodes, and still more from alexandria; in arabia in november it is hidden during the first quarter of the night and shows itself in the second; at meroe it appears a little in the evening at midsummer and a few days before the rising of areturus is seen at daybreak. these phenomena are most clearly disclosed by the voyages of those at sea, the sea sloping upward in the direction of some and downward in the direction of others, and the stars that were hidden behind the curve of the ball suddenly becoming visible as it were rising out of the sea. for it is not the fact, as some have said, that the world rises up at this higher pole â€” or else these stars would be visible everywhere; but these stars are believed to be higher the nearer people are to them, while they seem low to those far away, and just as at present this pole seems lofty to those situated on the declivity, so when people pass across to yonder downward slope of the earth those stars rise while the ones that here were high sink, which could not happen except with the conformation of a ball.
