the common kind of paste for paper is made fine flour of the best quality mixed with boiling water, with a very small sprinkle of vinegar; for carpenter's paste and gum make too brittle a compound. but a more careful process is to strain the crumb of leavened bread in boiling water; this method requires the smallest amount of paste at the seams, and produces a paper softer than even linen. but all the paste used ought to be exactly a day old â€” not more nor yet less. afterwards the paper is beaten thin with a mallet and run over with a layer of paste, and then again has its creases removed by pressure and is flattened out with the mallet. this process may enable records to last a long time; at the house of the poet and most distinguished citizen pomponius secundus i have seen documents in the hand of tiberius and gaius gracchus written nearly two hundred years ago; while as for autographs of cicero, of his late majesty augustus, and of virgil, we see them constantly.
