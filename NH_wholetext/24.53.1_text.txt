the rhododendros has not even found a latin name among the romans, names for it being rhododaphne or nerium. it is a strange fact that, while its leaves are poisonous to quadrupeds, to man on the other hand, if rue is added and the mixture taken in wine, they are a protection against the poison of snakes. sheep too and goats, if they drink water in which these leaves have been steeped, are said to be killed by it.
