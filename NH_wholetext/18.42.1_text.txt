in old times there was a kind of fodder which cato calls ocinum, used to stop scouring in oxen. this was got from a crop of fodder cut green before it seeded. mamilius sura gives another meaning to the name, and records that the old practice was to mix ten pecks of bean, two of vetch and the same of fitch for each acre of land and sow this mixture in autumn, preferably with some greek oats mixed in as well, as this does not drop its seed; he says that the usual name for this mixture was ocinum, and that it used to be grown for cattle. varro explains the name as due to its rapid growth, deriving it from the greek word for 'quickly'.
