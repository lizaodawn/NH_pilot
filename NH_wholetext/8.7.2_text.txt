a story is told that the animal's natural gentleness towards those not so strong as itself is so great that if it gets among a flock of sheep it will remove with its trunk those that come in its way, so as not unwittingly to crush one. also they never do any harm unless provoked, and that although they go about in herds, being of all animals the least solitary in habit. when surrounded by horsemen they withdraw. the weak ones or those that are exhausted or wounded into the middle of their column, and advance into the fighting line in relays as if by command or strategy. when captured they are very quickly tamed by means of barley juice.
