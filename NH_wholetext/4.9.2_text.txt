from scyllaion to the isthmus of corinth is a distance of 177 miles. we find here the towns of hermione, troezen, coryphasium, and argos, sometimes called "inachian," sometimes "dipsian" argos. then comes the port of schoenites, and the saronic gulf, which was formerly encircled with a grove of oaks, from which it derives its present name, oaks in ancient greece having been so called. upon this gulf is the town of epidaurus, famous for its temple of aesculapius, the promontory of spiraion, the port of anthedus, bucephalus, and then cenchreae, previously mentioned, on this side of the isthmus, with its temple of neptune, famous for the games celebrated there every five years. so many are the gulfs which penetrate the shores of the peloponnesus, so many the seas which howl around it. invaded by the ionian on the north, it is beaten by the sicilian on the west, buffeted by the cretan on the south, by the aegean on the s.e., and by the myrtoan on the n.e.; which last sea begins at the gulf of megara, and washes all the coast of attica.
