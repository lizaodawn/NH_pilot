but there are also instances of occasional mercifulness even in lions. the syracusan mentor in syria met a lion that rolled on the ground in suppliant wise and struck such terror into him that he was running away, when the lion stood in his way wherever he turned, and licked his footsteps as if fawning on him; he noticed a swelling and a wound in its foot, and by pulling out a thorn set the creature free from torment: a picture at syracuse is evidence of this occurrence. in a similar manner a native of samos named elpis on landing from a ship in africa, saw near the coast a lion opening its jaws in a threatening way, and took refuge up a tree, calling on father liber for help, since the chief occasion for praying is an emergency where there is no room for hope. the beast had not stood in his way when he tried to run away although it might have done, and lying down by the tree began to beg for compassion with the gaping jaws by which it had scared the man. owing to its biting its food too greedily a bone had stuck in its teeth, and was tormenting it with starvation and not merely with the punishment contained in the actual prickles, as it gazed up and looked as if making a silent prayer for aid - while chance events are not to be relied on in face of a wild animal, and much longer hesitation is caused by surprise than by alarm. but finally he came down and pulled out the bone for the lion, which held out its foot to him and adjusted it at the most necessary angle; and they say that as long as that vessel remained on the coast the lion displayed its gratitude by bringing its catches to its benefactor. this led elpis to consecrate in samos a temple to father liber, to which from that occurrence the greeks have given the name of temple of dionysus with his mouth open. after this do not let us be surprised that men's tracks are recognized by wild beasts when they actually hope for assistance from one of the animal race: for why did they not go to other animals, or how do they know of man's healing touch? unless perchance violent maladies force even wild animals to every expedient.
