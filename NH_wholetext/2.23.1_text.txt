some comets move, like the planets, but others are fixed and stationary, almost all of them towards the due north, not in any particular part of it, though chiefly in the luminous region called the milky way. aristotle also records that several may be seen at the same time — a fact not observed by anyone else, as far as i am aware — and that this signifies severe winds or heat. comets also occur in the winter months and at the south pole, but comets in the south have no rays. a terrible comet was seen by the people of ethiopia and egypt, to which typhon the king of that period gave his name; it had a fiery appearance and was twisted like a coil, and it was very grim to behold: it was not really a star so much as what might be called a ball of fire. planets and all other stars also occasionally have spreading hair. but sometimes there is a comet in the western sky, usually a terrifying star and not easily expiated: for instance, during the civil disorder in the consulship of octavius, and again during the war between pompey and caesar, or in our day about the time of the poisoning which secured the bequest of the empire by claudius caesar to domitius nero, and thereafter during nero's principate shining almost continuously and with a terrible glare. people think that it matters in what direction a comet darts, what star's strength it borrows, what shapes it resembles, and in what places it shines; that if it resembles a pair of flutes. it is a portent for the art of music, in the private parts of the constellations it portends immorality, if it forms an equilateral triangle or a rectangular quadrilateral in relation to certain positions of the fixed stars, it portends men of genius and a revival of learning, in the head of the northern or the southern serpent it brings poisonings.
