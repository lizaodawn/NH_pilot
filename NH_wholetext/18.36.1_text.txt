the next most extensively used plant is the lupine, as it is shared by men and hoofed quadrupeds in common. to prevent its escaping the reapers by jumping out of the pod the best remedy is to gather it immediately after rain. and of all crops sown none has a more remarkable quality of sensitiveness to the heavenly bodies and the soil. in the first place it turns round every day with the sun, and tells the time to the husbandman even in cloudy weather. moreover it blossoms three times and buds three times; all the same, it does not like to be covered with earth, and it is the only seed that is sown without the ground being ploughed. it requires most of all a gravelly and dry and even sandy soil, and in any case needs no cultivation. it has such a love for the earth that when it falls on soil however much overgrown with briars it penetrates among leaves and brambles and gets through with its root to the ground.
