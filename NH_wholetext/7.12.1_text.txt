(we are told that in the lepidus family three children were born, though not all in succession, with a membrane over the eyes); and indeed that other children have resembled their grandfather, and that also there has been a case of twins of which one resembled the father and the other the mother, and one of a child who resembled his brother like a twin although born a year later. also that some women always bear children like themselves, some bear children like their husbands, some children with no family likeness, some a female child like its father and a male child like themselves. one unquestioned instance is that of the famous boxer nicaeus, born at istamboul, whose mother was the offspring of adultery with an ethiopian but had a complexion no different from that of other women, whereas nicaeus himself reproduced his ethiopian grandfather.
