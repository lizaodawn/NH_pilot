the insects with hard eyes have the front feet longer, so that they may occasionally rub their feet eyes with their feet, as we observe in houseflies. insects with long hind feet leap, for instance locusts. but all these have six feet. some spiders have two very long feet in addition. each foot has two joints. we have said that some marine species also have eight feet, octopuses, cuttlefish of both varieties, and crabs, which move their fore-feet in the opposite direction to the others and their hind-feet in a circle or slantwise; they are also the only animals with feet of a rounded shape. all the other species have two guiding feet, only crabs have four. land species that exceed this number of feet, as most worms, have not less than twelve, and some as many as a hundred. no kind has an odd number of feet.
