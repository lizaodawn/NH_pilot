having so far pointed out the chief painters in both branches, we will also mention those of the rank next to the first: aristoclides who decorated the temple of apollo at delphi, antiphilus who is praised for his boy blowing a fire, and for the apartment, beautiful in itself, lit by the reflection from the fire and the light thrown on the boy's face; and likewise for his spinning-room, in which all the women are busily plying their tasks, and his ptolemy hunting, but, most famous of all, his satyr with leopard's skin, called in greek the man shading his eyes. aristophon did an ancaeus wounded by the boar, with astypale sharing his grief, and a picture crowded with figures, among them priam, helen, credulity, odysseus, deiphobus, craft. androbius painted a scyllus cutting the anchor-ropes of the persian fleet, artemon a danae admired by the robbers, a queen stratonice, and a heracles and deianira; but the finest of all his works, now in octavia's buildings, are his heracles ascending to heaven with the consent of the gods after his mortal remains were burnt on mount oita in doris, and the story of laomedon in the matter of heracles and poseidon. alcimachus painted dioxippus, who won the all-round bout at olympia 'without raising any dust,' akoniti as the greek word is. coenus painted pedigrees.
