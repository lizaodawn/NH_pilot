the ore is sometimes red, sometimes ash-coloured. it cannot be smelted except when combined with lead or with the vein of lead, called galena, lead ore, which is usually found running near veins of silver ore. also when submitted to the same process of firing, part of the ore precipitates as lead while the silver floats on the surface, like oil on water.
