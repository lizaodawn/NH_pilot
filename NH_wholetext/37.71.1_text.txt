there is still another way of classifying precious stones, and it is one which i should like to employ, now that i have already from time to time varied my method of presenting my theme. for there are stones named after parts of the body, for example 'hepatitis' after the liver, and numerous past kinds of steatitis after the fat found in one animal or another. we find 'adad's kidney,' 'adad's eye' and 'adad's finger,' adad also being a god who is worshipped by the syrians. again, 'triophthalmos' is a variety of onyx that displays the likeness of three human eyes simultaneously.
