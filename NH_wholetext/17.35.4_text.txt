vines give more numerous kinds of shoots for planting. the first point is that none of these are used for planting except useless growths lopped off for brush-wood, whereas any branch that bore fruit last time is pruned away. it used to be the custom to plant the shoot with a knob of the hard wood on each side of it, and this explains why it is still called a 'mallet-shoot'; but afterwards the practice began of pulling it off with its own heel, as is done in the case of the fig; and there is no kind of slip that grows better. a third kind has been added that strikes even quicker, which has the heel removed; these slips are called 'arrows' when they are twisted before being set out, 'three-bud slips' when they are cut off and set without being twisted. by this method several can be obtained from the same shoot. to plant from young leafy shoots is unproductive, and a slip for planting must only be taken from a shoot that has already borne fruit. a shoot that has few knots in it is deemed unlikely to bear, whereas a crowd of buds is a sign of fertility. some people say that only shoots that have flowered should be planted. it does not pay so well to plant arrow-slips, because anything that is twisted easily gets broken in being moved. shoots chosen for planting should be not less than a foot long, with five or six knots; that length of shoot will not possibly have less than three buds. it pays best to plant them on the same day as they are cut off, or if a considerable postponement cannot be avoided, to keep them well protected, as we have instructed, or at all events to be careful not to lay them down on the surface of the earth and let them be dried up by the sun and nipped by wind or frost. shoots that have been left too long in a dry place should be soaked in water for several days to restore their freshness.
