there are several kinds of wheat that have been produced by various races. for my own part i should not rank any of them with italian wheat for whiteness and for weight, for which it is particularly distinguished. foreign wheat can only be compared with that of the mountain regions of italy; among foreign kinds boeotia has obtained the first rank, then sicily, and after that africa. the third place for weight used to belong to thracian and syrian wheat and later also to egyptian, by the vote of athletes in those days, whose capacity for cereals, resembling that of cattle, had established the order of merit that we have stated. greece also gave praise to wheat from pontus, which did not get through to italy; but of all the varieties of grain greece gave the preference to dracontias, strangias and the wheat of selinunte, recognized by the thickness of the straw, because of which it used to count these kinds as appropriate for a rich soil. for sowing in damp soils greece prescribed spendias, a very light and extremely scanty-growing grain with a very thin stalk, because it required a great deal of nourishment. these were the opinions held in the reign of alexander the great, when greece was most famous and the most powerful state in the whole world, although nevertheless about 145 years before his death the poet sophocles in his play triptolemus praised italian corn before all other kinds, in the phrase of which a literal translation is 'and that happy italy glows white with bright white wheat'; and also today the italian wheat is especially distinguished for whiteness, which makes it more surprising to me that the later greeks have made no mention of this corn.
