myron, who was born at eleutherae, was himself also a pupil of hagelades; he was specially famous for his statue of a heifer, celebrated in some well-known sets of verses â€” inasmuch as most men owe their reputation more to someone else's talent than to their own. his other works include ladas and a 'discobolos' or man throwing a discus, and perseus, and the sawyers, and the satyr marvelling at the flute and athene, competitors in the five bouts at delphi, the all-round fighters, the heracles now in the house of pompey the great at the circus maximus. erinna in her poems indicates that he even made a memorial statue of a tree-cricket and a locust. he also made an apollo which was taken from the people of ephesus by antonius the triumvir but restored to them by his late lamented majesty augustus in obedience to a warning given him in a dream. myron is the first sculptor who appears to have enlarged the scope of realism, having more rhythms in his art than polycleitus and being more careful in his proportions. yet he himself so far as surface configuration goes attained great finish, but he does not seem to have given expression to the feelings of the mind, and moreover he has not treated the hair and the pubes with any more accuracy than had been achieved by the rude work of olden days.
