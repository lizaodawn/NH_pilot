statues of persons on foot undoubtedly held the field at rome for a long time; equestrian statues also however are of considerable antiquity, and this distinction was actually extended to women with the equestrian statue of cloelia, as if it were not enough for her to be clad in a toga, although statues were not voted to lucretia and brutus, who had driven out the kings owing to whom cloelia had been handed over with others as a hostage should have held the view that her statue and that of codes were the first erected at the public expense — for it is probable that the monuments to attus and the sibyl were erected by tarquin and those of the kings by themselves — were it not for the statement of piso that the statue of cloelia also was erected by the persons who had been hostages with her, when they were given back by porsena, as a mark of honour to her; whereas on the other hand annius fetialis states that an equestrian figure which once stood opposite the temple of jupiter stator in the forecourt of tarquinius superbus's palace was the statue of valeria, daughter of publicola, the consul, and that she alone had escaped and had swum across the tiber, the other hostages who were being sent to porsena having been made away with by a stratagem of tarquin.
