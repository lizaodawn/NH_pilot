we have now practically indicated the nature of metals, in which wealth consists, and of the substances related to them, connecting the facts in such a way as to indicate at the same time the enormous topic of medicine and the mysteries of the manufactories and the fastidious subtlety of the processes of carving and modelling and dyeing. there remain the various kinds of earth and of stones, forming an even more extensive series, each of which has been treated in many whole volumes, especially by greeks. for our part in these topics we shall adhere to the brevity suitable to our plan, yet omitting nothing that is necessary or follows a law of nature. and first we shall say what remains to be said about painting, an art that was formerly illustrious, at the time when it was in high demand with kings and nations and when it ennobled others whom it deigned to transmit to posterity. but at the present time it has been entirely ousted by marbles, and indeed finally also by gold, and not only to the point that whole party-walls are covered â€” we have also marble engraved with designs and embossed marble slabs carved in wriggling lines to represent objects and animals. we are no longer content with panels nor with surfaces displaying broadly a range of mountains in a bedchamber; we have begun even to paint on the masonry. this was invented in the principate of claudius, while in the time of nero a plan was discovered to give variety to uniformity by inserting markings that were not present in the embossed marble surface, so that numidian stone might show oval lines and synnadic marble be picked out with purple, just as fastidious luxury would have liked them to be by nature. these are our resources to supplement the mountains when they fail us, and luxury is always busy in the effort to secure that if a fire occurs it may lose as much as possible.
