the length of the nearer spain, from the pyrenees to the frontier of castulo, is 607 miles, and a little more if we follow the line of the coast; while its breadth, from tarraco to the shore of olarson, is 307 miles. from the foot of the pyrenees, where it is wedged in by the near approach of the two seas, it gradually expands until it touches the farther spain, and thereby acquires a width more than double.
