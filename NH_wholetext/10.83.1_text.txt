man is the only viviparous biped. man is the only animal with which mating for the first time is followed by repugnance, which is doubtless an augury of life as sprung from regrettable source. all the other animals have fixed seasons of the year for mating, but man, as has been said, mates at every hour of the day and night. all the others experience satiety in coupling, but with man this is almost entirely absent. claudius caesar's consort messalina, thinking that this would be a truly regal triumph, selected for a competition in it a certain maid who was the most notorious of the professional prostitutes, and beat her in a twenty-four hours' match, with a score of twenty-five. in the human race the males have devised every out-of-the-way form of sexual indulgence, crimes against nature, but the females have invented abortion. how much more guilty are we in this department than the wild animals! hesiod has stated that men have stronger sexual appetites in winter and women in summer.
