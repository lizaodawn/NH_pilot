resembling this is a plant that the greeks call wild andraehle, the italians inlecebra. it has very small leaves, but broader than those of aizoum, and the head is shorter it grows in rocky districts and is gathered for food. all these have the same properties; they are cooling and astringent. fluxes of the eyes are cured by an application of the leaves or of the juice used as ointment. for it cleanses sores of the eyes, replaces lost tissue and makes them cicatrize; it unglues the eyelids when sticky. these plants also cure headaches if the temples are smeared with the juice or leaves; they neutralize the bite of venomous spiders; for aconite, however, an especially good antidote is the greater aizotim. it is also said that those who have this plant on their persons are not stung by scorpions. they also cure earache, as does the application of a moderate amount of juice of henbane, or of achillea, of the smaller centaury, of plantain, of peucedanum mixed with rose oil and poppy juice, and of acoron juice with rose leaves. but all these juices are warmed and injected with a strigil, cotyledon being good even for pus in the ears if warmed deer's marrow is added, or the juice of crushed root of ebulum strained through a cloth, then thickened in the sun and, when needed, diluted with rose oil and warmed. vervain cures swollen parotid glands, as does the plantain, and sideritis with old axle-grease.
