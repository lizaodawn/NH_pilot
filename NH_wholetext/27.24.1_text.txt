we romans call alum what the greeks call symphyton petraion. it is like ox cunila, with small leaves and three or four branches growing from the root, which have tips like those of thyme; a ligneous plant, scented, sweet to the taste, promoting saliva, and with a long, red root. it grows on rocks (hence its surname petraion, 'rocky'), and is very useful for affections of the sides and kidneys, for colic, chest, lungs, spitting of blood, and sore throat. the root is pounded and taken in drink or boiled down in wine; sometimes too this is used as embrocation. moreover, chewed it allays thirst, and is especially cooling to the lungs. it is also applied to dislocations and bruises, and it soothes the intestines. cooked in hot ashes, pounded, after removal of the pods, with nine peppercorns and taken in water, it is binding to the bowels. so excellent is it for healing wounds that, added even to pieces of meat that are being boiled, it binds them together. hence its greek name symphyton. it is also good for broken bones.
