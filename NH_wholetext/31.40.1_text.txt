(in one part of the provinces of spain they draw the brine from wells and call it maria.) the former indeed think that the wood used also makes a difference. the best is oak, for its pure ash by itself has the properties of salt; in some places hazel finds favour. so when brine is poured on it even wood turns into salt. whenever wood is used in its making salt is dark. i find in theophrastus that the umbrians were wont to boil down in water the ash of reeds and rushes, until only a very little liquid remained. moreover, from the liquor of salted foods salt is recovered by reboiling, and when evaporation is complete its saline character is regained. it is generally thought that the salt obtained from sardine brine is the most pleasant.
