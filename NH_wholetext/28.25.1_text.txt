lion fat with rose oil preserves fairness of complexion and keeps the face free from spots; it also cures frostbite and swollen joints. the lying magi promise those rubbed with this fat a readier popularity with peoples and with kings, especially when the fat is that between the brows, where no fat can be. similar promises are made about the possession of a tooth, especially one from the right side, and of the tuft beneath the muzzle. the gall, used with the addition of water as a salve, improves vision, and if lion fat is added a slight taste cures epilepsy, provided that those who have taken it at once aid its digestion by running. the heart taken as a food cures quartans; the fat with rose oil cures quotidians. wild beasts run away from those smeared with it, and it is supposed to protect even from treachery.
