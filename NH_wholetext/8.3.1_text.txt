it is known that one elephant which was rather slow-witted in understanding instructions given to it and had been punished with repeated beatings, was found in the night practising the same. it is surprising that they can even climb up ropes, but especially that they can come down them again, at all events when they are stretched at a slope. mucianus who was three times consul states that one elephant actually learnt the shapes of the greek letters, and used to write out in words of that language: 'i myself wrote this and dedicated these spoils won from the celts;' and also that he personally had seen elephants that, when having been brought by sea to pozzuoli they were made to walk off the ship, were frightened by the length of the gangway stretching a long way out from the land and turned round and went backwards, so as to cheat themselves in their estimation of the distance.
