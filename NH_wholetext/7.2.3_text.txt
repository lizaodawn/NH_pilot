crates of pergamum states that there was a race of men round parium on the dardanelles, whom he calls ophiogenes, whose custom it was to cure snakebites by touch and draw the poison out of the body by placing their hand on it. varro says that there are still a few people there whose spittle is a remedy against snakebites. according to the writings of agatharchides there was also a similar tribe in africa, the psylli, named after king psyllus, whose tomb is in the region of the greater syrtes. in their bodies there was engendered a poison that was deadly to snakes, and the smell of which they employed for sending snakes to sleep, while they had a custom of exposing their children as soon as they were born to the most savage snakes and of using that species to test the fidelity of their wives, as snakes do not avoid persons born with adulterous blood in them. this tribe itself has been almost exterminated by the nasamones who now occupy that region, but a tribe of men descended from those who had escaped or had been absent when the fighting took place survives today in a few places. a similar race lingers on in italy also, the marsi, said to be descended from the son of circe and to possess this natural property on that account. however, all men contain a poison available as a protection against snakes: people say that snakes flee from contact with saliva as from the touch of boiling water, and that if it gets inside their throats they actually die; and that this is especially the case with the saliva of a person fasting.
