hostus hostilius, who was the grandfather of king tullus hostilius, was crowned by romulus with a garland of leaves for having been the first to enter fidena. the elder publius decius, who was military tribune, received a garland of leaves from the army which he had saved from destruction in the war with the samnites when the consul cornelius cossus was [343 b.c] in command of our army. the civic wreath was first made of the leaves of the holm-oak, but afterwards preference was given to a wreath from the winter oak, which is sacred to jove, and also a variety was made with the common oak and the tree growing in the particular locality was given, only the honour awarded to the acorn being preserved! strict and therefore exclusive conditions were further imposed, which may be compared with that supreme wreath of the greeks which is bestowed beneath the tutelage of zeus himself and for which the winner's native place in its rejoicing breaks a passage through its city walls; these conditions were - to save the life of a fellow-citizen; to kill one of the enemy; that the place where the exploit occurred must not be occupied by the enemy on the same day; that the person rescued must admit the fact - witnesses otherwise are of no value; - and that it must have been a roman citizen: auxiliary forces, even though it is a king who is rescued, do not bestow this distinction. nor is the same honour any greater if the rescued person is a general, because the founders of this institution wished the honour to be supreme in the case of any citizen. the receiver of the wreath may wear it for the rest of his life; when he appears at the games it is the custom for even the senate always to rise at his entrance, and he has the right to sit next to the senators; and he himself and his father and his paternal grandfather are exempt from all public duties. siccius dentatus, as we have mentioned at the proper place, won fourteen civic wreaths, and capitolinus six, one in his case being actually for saving the life of his commanding officer servilius. scipio africanus refused to accept a wreath for rescuing his father at the trebbia. how worthy of eternity is a national character that rewarded exploits so distinguished with honour only, and whereas it enhanced the value of its other wreaths with gold, refused to allow the rescue of a citizen to be a thing of price, thus loudly proclaiming that it is wrong even to save the life of a human being for the sake of gain!
