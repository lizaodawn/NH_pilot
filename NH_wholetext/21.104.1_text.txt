parthenium is called leucanthes by some, and amaracum by others. celsus, among the latin writers calls it perdicium and muralis. it grows in the hedges of gardens, and has a white flower, the smell of an apple and a bitter taste. a decoction of this plant is used to make a sits â€” bath for induration and inflammation of the womb, and the dried plant is applied with honey and vinegar to bring away black bile. for this reason it is good for dizziness and stone in the bladder. it is used as an application for erysipelas, and also with old axle-grease for scrofulous sores. for tertian agues the magi recommend us to gather it with the left hand without looking back, while saying for whose sake it is being gathered; then a leaf of it should be placed under the tongue of the patient to be swallowed presently in a cyathus of water.
