when clouds sweep over the sky in fine weather, wind is to be expected in whichever quarter the clouds come from. if they mass together in the same place and when the sun approaches are scattered, and if this takes place from a northern direction, they will portend winds, but if from a southern, rain. if when the sun is setting clouds rise into the sky on either side of the sun, they will signify stormy weather; if they are more lowering in the east they threaten rain for the night, but if in the west, rain the next day. if a number of clouds spread like fleeces of wool in the east, they will presage rain lasting three days. when clouds settle down on the tops of the mountains, the weather will be stormy; but if the tops become clear, it will turn fine. when there is heavy white cloud, a hailstorm, a 'white storm' as it is called, will be imminent. a patch of cloud however small seen in a fine sky will give a storm of wind.
