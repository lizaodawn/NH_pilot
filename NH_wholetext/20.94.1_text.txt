spignel is not grown in italy except by medical men, and by very few of these. there are two kinds of it. the more famous is called athamanticum or athamanicum, because, as some think, it was discovered by athamas, or according to others because the most esteemed variety is found in athamania. its leaves are like those of anise, the stem being sometimes two feet high; it has many roots, slanting, dark, and occasionally deep, the plant being less red than the other kind. the root, pounded or boiled and taken in water, is diuretic, and wonderfully good for dispersing flatulence of the stomach, and also for griping and troubles of the bladder and of the womb. with honey it is applied to the joints, and an application with celery to the lower abdomen is diuretic for babies.
