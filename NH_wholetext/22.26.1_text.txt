chamomile is most highly praised by asclepiades. some call it white chamomile, others leucanthemum, others eranthemis, because it blossoms in spring, others ground-apple (chamemelon), because it has the smell of an apple. a few call it melanthion. its three varieties differ only in their blossom; they are no taller than a span, with small leaves like those of rue, and with blossom that is white or apple-yellow or purple. it is gathered in spring on thin soils or near footpaths, and put by for making chaplets. at the same season physicians also make up into lozenges the pounded leaves, as well as the blossom and the root. all three are mixed and given in doses of one drachma for the bites of every kind of snake. taken in drink they bring away the dead foetus, are emmenagogues and diuretic, as well as good for stone, flatulence, affections of the liver, for excessive secretion of bile and for fistula of the eye; chewed it heals running sores. of all these kinds the most efficacious for stone in the bladder is that which has a purple flower, the leaves and stem of which arc of a rather larger size. some people give the name eranthemis exclusively to this variety.
