geranion is called by some myrris and by others myrtidas. it resembles hemlock, but with smaller leaves and shorter in the stem, round, and of a pleasant taste and smell. in this way it is described by our roman authorities; but greeks say that it has leaves a little lighter in colour than those of the mallow, thin stems, and downy, with branches at interval and two spans long; on them are the leaves, among which on the tips of the stems are miniature heads of cranes. a second kind has leaves like those of anemone, which are marked with rather long incisions, and a round root like an apple, sweet, and very beneficial to convalescents. the last seems to be the true geranion. it is taken in drink for consumption twice a day in doses of one drachma in three cyathi of wine; the same prescription is good for flatulence, and eaten raw the plant has the same effect. the juice of the root is good for ear trouble; for opisthotonic tetanus four-drachmae doses of seed are taken in drink with pepper and myrrh. consumption is cured too by drinking plantain juice, and by plantain itself boiled and taken as food. eaten with salt and oil on waking from sleep in the morning it is very refreshing. it is also given every other day to those who we say are wasting away, but to consumptives we give betony made up with honey into an electuary of the size of a bean, or agarie in raisin wine in two-oboli doses, or daucum with the greater centaury in wine. cases of phagedaena, a word meaning bulimia as well as rodent ulcer, are treated by tithymallus with sesame.
