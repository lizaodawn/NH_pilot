epirus, generally so called, begins at the mountains of acroceraunia. the first people that we meet are the chaones, from whom chaonia receives its name, then the thesproti, and then the antigonenses. we then come to the place where aornos stood, with its exhalations so deadly to the feathered race, the cestrinis, the perrhaebi, in whose country mount pindus is situate, the cassiopaei, the dryopes, the sellae, the hellopes, the molossi, in whose territory is the temple of the dodonaean jupiter, so famous for its oracle; and mount tomarus, so highly praised by theopompus, with its hundred springs gushing from its foot.
