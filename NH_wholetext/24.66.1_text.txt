the seed of the white thorn is a help against the stings of scorpions, and a crown of it when worn lessens headache. like it is the plant called acanthion by the greeks, but this has much smaller leaves, which have prickly points and are covered with down like cobweb. in the east this is even gathered to make a silk-like cloth. the leaves by themselves, or the roots, are taken in drink as a cure for opisthotonic tetanus.
