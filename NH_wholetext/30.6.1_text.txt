the magi have certain means of evasion; for example that the gods neither obey those with freckles nor are seen by them. was this perhaps their objection to nero? but his body was without blemish; he was free to choose the fixed days, could easily obtain perfectly black sheep, and as for human sacrifice, he took the greatest delight in it. mithridates the magus had come to him bringing a retinue for the annenian triumph over himself, thereby laying a heavy burden on the provinces. he had refused to travel by sea, for the magi hold it sin to spit into the sea or wrong that element by other necessary functions of mortal creatures. he had brought magi with him, had initiated nero into their banquets; yet the man giving him a kingdom was unable to acquire from him the magic art. therefore let us be convinced by this that magic is detestable, vain, and idle; and though it has what i might call shadows of truth, their power comes from the art of the poisoner, not of the magi. one might well ask what were the lies of the old magi, when as a youth i saw apion the grammarian, who told me that the herb cynocephalia, called in egypt osiritis, was an instrument of divination and a protection from all kinds of sorcery, but if it were uprooted altogether the digger would die at once, and that he had called up ghosts to inquire from homer his native country and the name of his parents, but did not dare to repeat the answers which he said were given.
