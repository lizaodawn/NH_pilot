below its union with the glanis from arretinum the tiber is swollen by two and forty streams, particularly the nar and the anio, which last is also navigable and shuts in latium at the back; it is also increased by the numerous aqueducts and springs which are conveyed to the city. here it becomes navigable by vessels of any burden which may come up from the italian sea; a most tranquil dispenser of the produce of all parts of the earth, and peopled and embellished along its banks with more villas than nearly all the other rivers of the world taken together. and yet there is no river more circumscribed than it, so close are its banks shut in on either side; but still, no resistance does it offer, although its waters frequently rise with great suddenness, and no part is more liable to be swollen than that which runs through the city itself. in such case, however, the tiber is rather to be looked upon as pregnant with prophetic warnings to us, and in its increase to be considered more as a promoter of religion than a source of devastation.
