for my own part i am surprised that aristotle not only believed but also published his belief that our bodies contain premonitory signs of our career. but although i think this view unfounded, and not proper to be brought forward without hesitation lest everybody should anxiously seek to find these auguries in himself, nevertheless i will touch upon it, because so great a master of the sciences as aristotle has not despised it. well then, he puts down as signs of a short life few teeth, very long fingers, a leaden complexion and an exceptional number of broken creases in the hand; and on the other side he says that those people are long-lived who have sloping shoulders, one or two long creases in the hand, more than thirty-two teeth, and large ears. yet he does not, i imagine, note all these attributes present in one person, but separately, trifling things, as i consider them, though nevertheless commonly talked about. in a similar manner among ourselves trogus, himself also one of the most critical authorities, has added some outward signs of character which i will append in his own words: 'when the forehead is large it indicates that the mind beneath it is sluggish; people with a small forehead have a nimble mind, those with a round forehead an irascible mind' â€” as if this were a visible indication of a swollen temper! 'when people's eyebrows are level this signifies that they are gentle, when they are curved at the side of the nose, that they are stern, when bent down at the temples, that they are mockers, when entirely drooping, that they are malevolent and spiteful. if people's eyes are narrow on both sides, this shows them to be malicious in character; eyes that have fleshy corners on the side of the nostrils show a mark of maliciousness; when the white part of the eyes is extensive it conveys an indication of impudence; eyes that have a habit of repeatedly closing indicate unreliability. large ears are a sign of talkativeness and silliness,' thus far trogus.
