thus far have i treated of the position and the wonders of the earth, of the waters, the stars, and the proportion of the universe and its dimensions. i shall now proceed to describe its individual parts; although indeed we may with reason look upon the task as of an infinite nature, and one not to be rashly commenced upon without incurring censure. and yet, on the other hand, there is nothing which ought less to require an apology, if it is only considered how far from surprising it is that a mere mortal cannot be acquainted with everything. i shall therefore not follow any single author, but shall employ, in relation to each subject, such writers as i shall look upon as most worthy of credit. for, indeed, it is the characteristic of nearly all of them, that they display the greatest care and accuracy in the description of the countries in which they respectively flourished; so that by doing this, i shall neither have to blame nor contradict any one.
