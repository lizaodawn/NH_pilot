this is also the time for planting mint, using a shoot, or if it is not yet making bud, a matted tuft. mint is equally fond of damp ground. it is green in summer and turns yellow in winter. there is a wild kind of mint called mentastrum; this is propagated by layering, like a vine, or by planting stalks end downwards. the name of mint has been altered in greece because of its sweet scent; it used to be called mintha, from which our ancestors derived the latin name, but now it has begun to be called by a greek word meaning 'sweet-scented'. it is agreeable for stuffing cushions, and pervades the tables with its scent at country banquets. one planting lasts for a long period. it is closely related to pennyroyal, which has the property which we have spoken of more than once of flowering when it is in a larder. these other herbs, i mean mint and also pennyroyal and catmint, are kept in the same kind of way. yet of all the seasonings which gratify a fastidious taste, cummin is the most agreeable. it grows on the surface of the ground, hardly adhering to the soil and stretching upward, and it should be sown in the middle of spring, in crumbly and specially warm soils. another kind of cummin is the wild variety called country cummin, or by other people thebaic cummin. for pounding up in water and using as a draught in cases of stomachache the most highly esteemed kind in our continent is that grown at carpetania, though elsewhere the prize is awarded to ethiopian and african cummin; however some prefer the egyptian to the african.
