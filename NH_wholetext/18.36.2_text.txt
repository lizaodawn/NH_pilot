we have stated that fields and vineyards are enriched by a crop of lupines; and thus it has so little need for manure that it serves instead of manure of the best quality, and there is no other crop that costs no expenditure at all â€” seeing that it does not require carrying to the spot even for the purpose of sowing: it sows itself directly from the crop, and does not even need to be scattered, falling on the ground of its own accord. and it is the earliest of all crops to be sown and the latest to be carried, both operations generally taking place in september, because if it does not grow ahead of winter it is liable to suffer from frost. moreover it can be left just lying on the ground with impunity, as it is protected from all animals by its bitter flavour if a fall of rain does not occur immediately so as to cover it up; although nevertheless growers usually cover it up in a light furrow. among thicker soils it likes red earth best; to enrich this it must be turned up after the plant has blossomed three times, but when planted in gravel the soil must be turned after every second blossoming. the only kinds of soil it positively dislikes are chalky and muddy soils, and in these it comes to nothing. it is used as a food for mankind as well after being steeped in hot water; as for cattle, a peck per head of stock makes ample and strength-giving feed, while it is also used medicinally for children as a poultice on the stomach. it suits the seed best to be stored in a smoky place, as in a damp place maggots attack the germ and reduce it to sterility. if lupine is grazed off by cattle while in leaf, the only thing to be done is to plough it in at once.
