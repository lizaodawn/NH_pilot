the chamaeleon is called by some ixia. there are two kinds of it. the whiter has rougher leaves, and creeps along the ground raising its prickles as the hedgehog does his quills; it has a sweet root and a strong smell. in some districts it exudes a white viscous substance just where the leaves join the stem, especially about the time the dog-star rises, in the way frankincense is said to form, and this is why it is also called ixia. women use it as chewing-gum. the other name chamaeleon comes from the varied colour of its leaves; for it changes its colour with the soil - dark here, green there, in some places blue, in others saffron yellow, and of other colours elsewhere. a decoction of the root of the white variety cures dropsy, the dose being a drachma taken in raisin wine. intestinal parasites also are expelled by a dose of an acetabulum of the same juice taken in a harsh wine with sprigs of wild marjoram. it is diuretic. dogs too and pigs are killed by this juice in pearl barley with water and oil added. it attracts mice to itself, and kills them, unless they swallow water at once. some people recommend that its root be cut up and kept suspended by cords, and be boiled in food against those fluxes which the greeks call ÔÅÓµÔÖÓºÓ±ÔÑÓπÔÉÓºÓøÓØ. of the dark variety that with a purple flower is said by some to be the male plant, that with a violet flower the female. they grow together, with a stem a cubit high and of the thickness of a finger. their roots, boiled with sulphur together with bitumen, cure lichen; chewed, moreover, or boiled down in vinegar, they tighten loose teeth, and the juice cures the scab in animals. it kills ticks on dogs, as well as bullocks, choking them as a quinsy does, for which reason some call it ulophonon, and it is also called, because of its offensive smell, cynozolon. these plants too produce a viscous substance, which is very good for sores. the roots too of all their kinds are an antidote to the sting of the scorpion.
