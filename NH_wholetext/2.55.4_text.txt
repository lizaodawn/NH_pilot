lightning unaccompanied by thunder occurs more often by night than in the daytime. man is the one creature that is not always killed when struck - all others are killed on the spot; nature doubtless bestows this honour on man because so many animals surpass him in strength. all things (when struck) fall in the opposite direction to the flash. a man does not die unless the force of the blow turns him right round. men struck from above collapse. a man struck while awake is found with his eyes shut; while asleep, with them open. it is not lawful to cremate a man who loses his life in this manner; religious tradition prescribes burial. no living creature can be burnt by lightning without being killed. the temperature of the wound of those struck is lower than that of the rest of the body.
