capturing lions was once a difficult task, chiefly effected by means of pitfalls. in the principate of claudius accident taught a gaetulian shepherd a method that was almost one to be ashamed of in the case of a wild animal of this nature: when it charged he flung a cloak against its onset — a feat that was immediately transferred to the arena as a show — the creature's great ferocity abating in an almost incredible manner when its head is covered with even a light wrap, with the result that it is vanquished without showing fight. the fact is that all its strength is concentrated in its eyes, which makes it less remarkable that when lysimachus by order of alexander was shut up in a lion's cage he succeeded in strangling it. mark antony broke lions to the yoke and was the first person at rome to harness them to a chariot, and this in fact during the civil war, after the decisive battle in the plains of pharsalia, not without some intention of exhibiting the position of affairs, the portentous feat signifying that generous spirits can bow to a yoke. for his riding in this fashion with the actress cytheris at his side was a thing that outdid even the portentous oecnrrences of that disastrous period. it is recorded that hanno, one of the most distinguished of the carthaginians, was the first human being who dared to handle a lion and exhibit it as tamed, and that this supplied a reason for his impeachment, because it was felt that a man of such an artful character might persuade the public to anything, and that their liberty was ill entrusted to one to whom even ferocity had so completely submitted.
