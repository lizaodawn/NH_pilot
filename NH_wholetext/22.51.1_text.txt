in dealing with the benefits of honey i must include those of hydromel. there are two kinds of it: one is made for the occasion and used fresh, and the other is the matured. occasional hydromel, made from skimmed honey, is extremely useful as an ingredient of the light diet of invalids (that is strained wheat) for restoring the strength, for soothing the mouth and stomach, and for cooling feverish heat. for it is cold hydromel that is better to be given for loosening the bowels. my authorities state that it should be given to drink to persons subject to chill, and also to those of a poor, weak spirit, whom the same authorities called μικρόψυχοι in harmony with the very ingenious theory that had its origin in plato. this says that the atoms of things, being smooth or rough, angular or round, are accordingly more or less adapted to the nature of different individuals, and that therefore the same things are not bitter or sweet to everybody; and so, when we are tired or thirsty we are more prone to anger. therefore also this roughness of the mind, or rather i should say of the soul, is made smoother by a sweeter flavour, which soothes the windpipe and makes more gentle the passage of the breath, so that neither inhalation nor exhalation is violently broken. each of us may make trial for himself. there is no one who does not find that by food can be softened his anger, grief, sadness, and every violent emotion of the mind. accordingly i must take notice not only of things which give healing to our bodies, but also of those which heal our character.
