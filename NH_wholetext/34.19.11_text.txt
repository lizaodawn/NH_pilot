praxiteles although more successful and therefore more celebrated in marble, nevertheless also made some very beautiful works in bronze: the rape of persephone, also the girl spinning, and a father liber or dionysus, with a figure of drunkenness and also the famous satyr, known by the greek title periboetos meaning 'celebrated,' and the statues that used to be in front of the temple of felicitas, and the aphrodite, which was destroyed by fire when the temple of that goddess was burnt down in the reign of claudius, and which rivalled the famous aphrodite, in marble, that is known all over the world; also a woman bestowing a wreath, a woman putting a bracelet on her arm, autumn, harmodius and aristogeiton who slew the tyrant the last piece carried off by xerxes king of the persians but restored to the athenians by alexander [331 bc] the great after his conquest of persia. praxiteles also made a youthful apollo called in greek the lizard-slayer because he is waiting with an arrow for a lizard creeping towards him. also two of his statues expressing opposite emotions are admired, his matron weeping and his merry courtesan. the latter is believed to have been phryne and connoisseurs detect in the figure the artist's love of her and the reward promised him by the expression on the courtesan's face. the kindness also of praxiteles is represented in sculpture, as in the chariot and four of calamis he contributed the charioteer, in order that the sculptor might not be thought to have failed in the human figure although more successful in representing horses. calamis himself also made other chariots, some with four horses and some with two, and in executing the horses he is invariably unrivalled: but — that it may not be supposed that he was inferior in his human figures — his alcmena is as famous as that of any other sculptor.
