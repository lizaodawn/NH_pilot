the most striking symptom of jaundice is the effect upon the eyes; the bile penetrates even between the membranes, thin and close together as they are. hippocrates says that if jaundice supervenes from the seventh day of a fever it is a fatal symptom. i however know of recoveries even from this desperate condition. but cases of jaundice occur without fever, and can be overcome by the greater centaury, taken in drink as i have prescribed, by betony, by three-oboli doses of agaric in a cyathns of old wine, and by three-oboli doses of vervain leaves taken for four days in a hemina of warmed wine. the quickest remedy however is juice of cinquefoil taken in doses of three cyathi with salt and honey. three-drachmae doses of root of cyclamen are taken in drink while the patient is in a warm place protected from chilly draughts — the medicine induces sweats full of gall — and good is done by leaves of tussilago in water, by seed of linozostis of either kind sprinkled in drink or boiled down with wormwood or chick peas, by hyssop berries taken with water, by the herb lichen, the patient during the treatment abstaining from all other vegetables, by polythrix administered in wine, and by struthion in honey wine.
