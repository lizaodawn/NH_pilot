in wheat the grain has several coats, but barley and good emmer wheat are largely naked, and the oat is especially so. wheat has a taller stalk than barley, but barley has a more prickly ear. hard wheat, common wheat and barley are threshed on a threshing floor; thus they are also sown without the husk, just as they are milled, because they are not dried first. on the other hand emmer wheat, and common and italian millet cannot be freed of husk until they have been dried, and consequently these grains are sown unthreshed, with their husks on. people also keep emmer in its little husks for sowing, and do not dry it by heat.
