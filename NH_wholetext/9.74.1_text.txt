the curiosity and wonder of mankind does not allow us to postpone the consideration of these animals' method of reproduction. fish couple by rubbing their bellies together so quickly as to escape the sight; dolphins and the rest of the large marine species couple in a similar manner, but with rather longer contact. at the coupling season the female fish pursues the male, nudging his belly with her nose, but directly after the eggs are born the males similarly pursue the females and eat their eggs. copulation is not enough in itself to cause the birth of offspring, unless when the eggs are laid the males swim to and fro sprinkling them with life-giving milk. this is not achieved with all the eggs in so great a multitude - otherwise the seas and marshes would be completely filled, since the uterus of a single fish holds a countless number of eggs.
