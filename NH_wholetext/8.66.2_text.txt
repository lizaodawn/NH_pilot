in the equine genus the pregnant female is delivered standing up; and she loves her offspring more than all other female animals. and in fact a love-poison called horse-frenzy is found in the forehead of horses at birth, the size of a dried fig, black in colour, which a brood mare as soon as she has dropped her foal eats up, or else she refuses to suckle the foal. if anybody takes it before she gets it, and keeps it, the scent drives him into madness of the kind specified. if a foal loses its dam the other brood mares in the same herd rear the orphan. it is said that a foal is unable to reach the ground with its mouth within the first three days after birth. the greedier it is in drinking the deeper it dips its nostrils into the water. the scythians prefer mares as chargers, because they can make water without checking their gallop.
