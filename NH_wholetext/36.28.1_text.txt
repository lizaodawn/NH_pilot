however, there are stones that are gentler in their effects in that they preserve a body without consuming it, for example, the 'chernites,' which closely resembles ivory and is said to be the material of which the coin of darius is said to have been made, and, again, a stone called 'porus,' which is similar to parian marble in whiteness and hardness, only not so heavy. theophrastus is our authority also for a translucent egyptian stone said by him to be similar to chian marble. such a stone may have existed in his time: stones cease to be found and new ones are discovered in turn.
