and the majority of these methods were taught us by nature herself, in particular that of sowing a seed, because when a seed fell from a tree and was received into the earth it came to life again. indeed there are some trees that are not grown in any other way, for instance chestnuts and walnuts, with the exception, that is, of those intended for felling; but also some grown in other ways are grown from seed as well, though a different kind of seed — for instance vines and apples and pears — as with these a pip serves as a seed, and not the actual fruit, as in the case of the trees mentioned above. also medlars can be grown from seed. all of these trees are slow in coming on, and liable to degenerate so as to have to be restored by grafting; and sometimes this happens even with chestnuts.
