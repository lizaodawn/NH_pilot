irrigation is good for trees in the heat of summer but bad for them in winter; in the autumn its effect varies and depends on the nature of the soil, inasmuch as in the spanish provinces the vintager picks the grapes when the ground is under water, whereas in the greater part of the world it pays to drain off the rain water even in autumn. irrigation is most beneficial about the rising of the dog-star, and even then not too much of it, because it hurts the roots when they are soaked to the point of intoxication. the age of the tree also controls the due amount; young saplings are not so thirsty. but those that require most watering are those that have been used to it, whereas those which have sprung up in dry places only need a bare minimum of moisture.
