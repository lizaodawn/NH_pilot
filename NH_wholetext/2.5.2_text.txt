nevertheless mortality has rendered our guesses about god even more obscure by inventing for itself a deity intermediate between these two conceptions. everywhere in the whole world at every hour by all men's voices fortune alone is invoked and named, alone accused, alone impeached, alone pondered, alone applauded, alone rebuked and visited with reproaches; deemed volatile and indeed by most men blind as well, wayward, inconstant, uncertain, fickle in her favours and favouring the unworthy. to her is debited all that is spent and credited all that is received, she alone fills both pages in the whole of mortals' account; and we are so much at the mercy of chance that chance herself, by whom god is proved uncertain, takes the place of god. another set of people banishes fortune also, and attributes events to its star and to the laws of birth, holding that for all men that ever are to be god's decree has been enacted once for all, while for the rest of time leisure has been vouchsafed to him. this belief begins to take root, and the learned and unlearned mob alike go marching on towards it at the double: witness the warnings drawn from lightning, the forecasts made by oracles, the prophecies of augurs, and even inconsiderable trifles - a sneeze, a stumble - counted as omens. his late majesty put abroad a story that on the day on which he was almost overthrown by a mutiny in the army he had put his left boot on the wrong foot. this series of instances entangles unforeseeing mortality, so that among these things but one thing is in the least certain - that nothing certain exists, and that nothing is more pitiable, or more presumptuous, than man! inasmuch as with the rest of living creatures their sole anxiety is for the means of life, in which nature's bounty of itself suffices, the one blessing indeed that is actually preferable to every other being the fact that they do not think about glory, money, ambition, and above all death.
