spiders couple with the haunches, and produce grubs resembling eggs â€” for their mode of reproduction also must not be deferred, as insects have scarcely any other method; and they lay them all into their webs, but scattered, because they jump about and lay them in the process. the phalangium spiders only incubate in the actual cave a large number of grubs which when hatched out devour the mother, and often the father too, for he helps to incubate. they produce broods of as many as three hundred, whereas all the other kinds produce fewer; and they sit on the eggs three days. they take four weeks to become full-grown spiders.
