also honey used even to be mixed with vinegar, so exhaustive have been men's experiments in living. this mixture was called in greek 'sour honey'; it was made with ten pounds of honey, 2 1/2 pints of old vinegar, one pound of sea salt and 5 pints of rainwater, heated to boiling ten times, after which the liquor was drawn off and so kept till it was old. all these wines are condemned by themison, who is a very high authority; and, i vow, the employment of them does appear to be a tour de force, unless anybody believes that aromatic wine and wines pounded of perfumes are products of nature, or that nature gave birth to shrubs in order for them to be used for drink! contrivances of this sort are amusing to learn of, owing to the ingenuity of the human mind that investigates everything. there can be no doubt that none of these wines will keep a year, except those which we have stated to be actually the products of age, and that the larger number of them will not keep even a month.
