the riches of earth's bounty were for a long time hidden, and the trees and forests were supposed to be the supreme gift bestowed by her on man. these first provided him with food, their foliage carpeted his cave and their bark served him for raiment; there are still races which practise this mode of life. this inspires us with ever greater and greater wonder that starting from these beginnings man has come to quarry the mountains for marbles, to go as far as china for raiment, and to explore the depths of the red sea for the pearl and the bowels of the earth for the emerald. for this purpose has been devised the fashion of making wounds in the ears, because forsooth it was not enough for jewels to be worn on the hands and neck and hair without making them even pierce through the body. consequently it will be well to follow the biological order and to speak of trees before earth's other products, and to bring forward origins for our customs.
