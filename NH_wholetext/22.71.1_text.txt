there is a wild lentil called elelisphacos by the greeks [sphacos by others], smoother than the cultivated lentil, with a smaller, drier and more scented leaf. there is also another kind of it wilder still, and with a heavy smell. the other, the more cultivated variety, has leaves like those of a quince, but smaller and pale, which are boiled with the branches. it promotes menstruation and urine, and heals the wounds of the stingray, numbing the region affected. it is also taken in drink with wormwood for dysentery. with wine it also brings on delayed menstruation, while a draught of its decoction checks any excess. the plant applied by itself stanches the blood of wounds. it also cures snake bite, and if boiled down in wine allays pruritus of the testicles. our modern herbalists call this plant elelisphacus in greek and salvia in latin, a plant like mint, hoary and aromatic. an application brings away the dead unborn baby, as well as worms in sores and ears.
