how melitites used to be made out of must and honey i have set out in my account of wine. i believe that this kind of honey has not been made now for generations, so liable was it to cause flatulence. when well matured, however, it used to be given in fever because of its action on the bowels, and also to sufferers from gout and from feebleness of the sinews, and to women who are teetotallers.
