the question as to the origin of the art of painting is uncertain and it does not belong to the plan of this work. the egyptians declare that it was invented among themselves six thousand years ago before it passed over into greece — which is clearly an idle assertion. as to the greeks, some of them say it was discovered at sikyon, others in corinth, but all agree that it began with tracing an outline round a man's shadow and consequently that pictures were originally done in this wax, but the second stage when a more elaborate method had been invented was done in a single colour and called monochrome, a method still in use at the present day. line-drawing was invented by the egyptian philocles or by the corinthian cleanthes, but it was first practised by the corinthian aridices and the sikyonian telephanes — these were at that stage not using any colour, yet already adding lines here and there to the interior of the outlines; hence it became their custom to write on the pictures the names of the persons represented. ecphantus of corinth is said to have been the first to daub these drawings with a pigment made of powdered earthenware. we shall show below that this was another person, bearing the same name, not the one recorded by cornelius nepos to have followed into italy demaratus the father of the roman king tarquinius priscus when he fled from corinth to escape the violence of the tyrant cypselus.
