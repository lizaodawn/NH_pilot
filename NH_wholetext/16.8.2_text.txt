there are two classes of holm-oak. the italian variety, called by some greeks milax, has a leaf not very different from that of the olive, but the holm-oak in the provinces is the one with pointed leaves. the acorn of both kinds is shorter and more slender than that of other varieties; homer calls it akylon and distinguishes it by that name from the common acorn. it is said that the male holm-oak bears no acorns.
