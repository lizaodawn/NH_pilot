the cynosbatos is called by some cynapanxis, by others neurospastos. it has a leaf like a man's foot-print. it also bears a black cluster, in the berry of which it has a string, whence the whole shrub is called neurospastos. it is different from the caper that the physicians have called cynosbatos. the stalk of this, pickled in vinegar, is chewed as a remedy for affections of the spleen and for flatulence. the string of it chewed up with chian mastic cleanses the mouth. the rose-blossom of brambles with axle-grease clears away mange; the berries mixed with oil of unripe grapes dye the hair. the blossom of the blackberry is gathered at harvest-time. the white blossom taken in wine is excellent for pleurisy and also for coeliac affections. the root, boiled down to one-third, checks looseness of the bowels and haemorrhage; the decoction also makes a wash that strengthens the teeth. with the same juice are fomented sores of the anus and of the genitals. the ash from the root replaces a relaxed uvula.
