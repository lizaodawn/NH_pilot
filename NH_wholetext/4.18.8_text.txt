what may be called a rock rather than an island, lying between tenos and chios, has given its name to the aegean sea; it has the name of aex from its strong resemblance to a goat, which is so called in greek, and shoots precipitately from out of the middle of the sea. those who are sailing towards the isle of andros from achaia, see this rock on the left, boding no good, and warning them of its dangers. part of the aegean sea bears the name of myrtoan, being so called from the small island [of myrtos ] which is seen as you sail towards macedonia from geraistos, not far from carystus in euboea. the romans include all these seas under two names, - the macedonian, in those parts where it touches the coasts of macedonia or thrace, and the grecian where it washes the shores of greece the greeks, however, divide the ionian sea into the sicilian and the cretan seas, after the name of those islands; and they give the name of icarian to that part which lies between samos and myconos. the gulfs which we have already mentioned, have given to these seas the rest of their names. such, then, are the seas and the various nations which are comprehended in the third great gulf of europe.
