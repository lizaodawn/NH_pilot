idumaea, palaestina, and samaria: on leaving pelusium we come to the camp of chabrias, mount casius, the temple of jupiter casius, and the tomb of pompeius magnus. ostracine, at a distance of sixty-five miles from pelusium, is the frontier town of arabia. after this, at the point where the sirbonian lake becomes visible, idumaea and palaestina begin. this lake, which some writers have made to be 150 miles in circumference, herodotus has placed at the foot of mount casius; it is now an inconsiderable fen. the towns are rhinocolura, and, in the interior, rhaphea, gaza, and, still more inland, anthedon: there is also mount argaris. proceeding along the coast we come to the region of samaria; ascalon, a free town, azotus, the two iamniae, one of them in the interior; and joppe, a city of the phoenicians, which existed, it is said, before the deluge of the earth. it is situate on the slope of a hill, and in front of it lies a rock, upon which they point out the vestiges of the chains by which andromeda was bound. here the fabulous goddess ceto is worshipped. next to this place comes apollonia, and then the tower of strato, otherwise caesarea, built by king herod, but now the colony of prima flavia, established by the emperor vespasianus: this place is the frontier town of palaestina, at a distance of 188 miles from the confines of arabia; after which comes phoenice. in the interior of samaria are the towns of neapolis, formerly called mamortha, sebaste, situate on a mountain, and, on a still more lofty one, gamala.
