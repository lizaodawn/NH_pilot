of the bronze which was renowned in early days, the corinthian is the most highly praised. this is a compound that was produced by accident, when corinth was burned at the time of its capture; and there has been a wonderful mania among many people for possessing this metal â€” in fact it is recorded that verres, whose conviction marcus cicero had procured, was, together with cicero, proscribed by antony for no other reason than because he had refused to give up to antony some pieces of corinthian ware; and to me the majority of these collectors seem only to make a pretence of being connoisseurs, so as to separate themselves from the multitude, rather than to have any exceptionally refined insight in this matter; and this i will briefly show. corinth was taken in the third year of the 158th olympiad, which was the 608th year [146 bc] of our city, when for ages there had no longer been any famous artists in metalwork; yet these persons designate all the specimens of their work as corinthian bronzes. in order therefore to refute them we will state the periods to which these artists belong; of course it will be easy to turn the olympiads into the years since the foundation of our city by referring to the two corresponding dates given above. the only genuine corinthian vessels are then those which your connoisseurs sometimes convert into dishes for food and sometimes into lamps or even washing basins, without nice regard for decency. there are three kinds of this sort of bronze: a white variety, coming very near to silver in brilliance, in which the alloy of silver predominates; a second kind, in which the yellow quality of gold predominates, and a third kind in which all the metals were blended in equal proportions. besides these there is another mixture the formula for which cannot be given, although it is man's handiwork; but the bronze valued in portrait statues and others for its peculiar colour, approaching the appearance of liver and consequently called by a greek name 'hepatizon' meaning 'liverish,' is a blend produced by luck; it is far behind the corinthian blend, yet a long way in front of the bronze of aigina and that of delos which long held the first rank.
