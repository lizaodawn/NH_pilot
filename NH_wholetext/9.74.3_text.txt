some creatures are born at a fixed season of the year, water species as well as those on land: scallops of and slugs and leeches in the spring; these also pass away at a fixed season. among fish the wolf-fish and the sardine breed twice a year, and so do all the rock-fish; some breed three times, for instance the herring; carp six times; sea-scorpions and twice, in spring and autumn: of the flat fish only the skate twice, in the autumn and at the setting of the pleiades; most fish in the three months of april, may and june; the stockfish in the autumn, the aargus, the torpedo and the squalus at the season of the equinox; soft fish in the spring; the cuttlefish in all the months - its eggs stick together with an inky gum like a bunch of grapes, and the male directs his breath upon them, otherwise they are barren. polyps mate in winter and lay eggs in spring that cluster in a twisting coil; and they are so prolific that when they are killed the cavity of their head will not hold the multitude of eggs that they carried in it when pregnant. they lay them after seven weeks, many of them perishing because of their number. langoustes rind the rest of the species with rather thin shells deposit their eggs underneath them and so hatch them; the female polyp now sits on the eggs and now forms a closed cavern with her tentacles intertwined in a lattice. the sepia lays on land among reeds or wherever there is seaweed growing, and hatches after a fortnight. the cuttlefish produces its eggs in deep water clustered together like those of the sepia. the purple-fish, the murex and their kind spawn in spring. sea-urchins have eggs at the full moons in winter, and snails are born in the winter time.
