i have spoken of the fame won by the geese which detected the ascent of the capitoline hill by the gauls. for the same reasons dogs are punished with death every year, being crucified alive on a cross of elder between the temple of juventas and that of sununanus. but the customs of the ancients compel me to say several other things about the dog. sucking puppies were thought to be such pure food that they even took the place of sacrificial victims to placate the divinities. genita mana is worshipped with the sacrifice of a puppy, and at dinners in honour of the gods even now puppy flesh is put on the table. that it was commonly in fact a special dish at inaugural banquets there is evidence in the comedies of plautus's dog's blood is supposed to be the best remedy for arrow poison, and this animal seems also to have shown mankind the use of emetics. other highly praised remedies from the dog i shall speak of on the appropriate occasions. i will now go on with my proposed plan.
