not all people's arms are a pair; it is known that a thracian gladiator named studiosus in gaius caesar's training-school had his right arm longer than his left. some animals use the service of their front feet as hands, and sit moving their food to their mouth with them, for instance squirrels. in fact the monkey tribes have a perfect imitation of a human being in their face, nostrils, cars and eyelashes - they are the only four-footed animals with eyelashes - on the lower lid as well, also paps on the breast, and arms and legs bending similarly in opposite directions, and nails on their hands, and fingers, and a longer middle finger. they differ a little from human beings in their feet, for these are very long like their hands, but make a foot-print like the palm of a hand. they also have a thumb and knuckles like a human being; and besides a genital organ, and this in the males only, they also have all internal organs to pattern.
