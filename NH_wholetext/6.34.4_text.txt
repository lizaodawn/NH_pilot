after passing this place we come to the azanian sea, a promontory by some writers called hispalus, lake mandalum, and the island of colocasitis, with many others lying out in the main sea, upon which multitudes of turtles are found. we then come to the town of suche, the island of daphnidis, and the town of the adulitae, a place founded by egyptian runaway slaves. this is the principal mart for the troglodytes, as also for the people of aethiopia: it is distant from ptolemais five days' sail. to this place they bring ivory in large quantities, horns of the rhinoceros, hides of the hippopotamus, tortoise-shell, sphingiae, and slaves. beyond the aethiopian aroterae are the islands known by the name of aliaeu, as also those of bacchias, antibacchias, and stratioton. after passing these, on the coast of aethiopia, there is a gulf which remains unexplored still; a circumstance the more to be wondered at, seeing that merchants have pursued their investigations to a greater distance than this. we then come to a promontory, upon which there is a spring called cucios, much resorted to by mariners. beyond it is the port of isis, distant ten days' rowing from the town of the adulitae: myrrh is brought to this port by the troglodytae. the two islands before the harbour are called pseudepylae, and those in it, the same in number, are known as pylae; upon one of these there are some stone columns inscribed with unknown characters. beyond these is the gulf of abalites, the island of diodorus, and other desert islands; also, on the mainland, a succession of deserts, and then the town of gaza, and the mossylites promontory and port, to the latter of which cinnamon is brought for exportation: it was thus far that sesostris led his army.
