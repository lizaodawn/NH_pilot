the sun itself has four differences, as there are two equinoxes, in spring and autumn, when it coincides with the centre of the earth at the eighth degree of aries and libra, and two changes of its course, in the eighth degree of capricorn at midwinter when the days begin to lengthen and in the same degree of cancer at the summer solstice. the variation is due to the slant of the zodiac, as at every moment an equal part of the firmament is above and below the earth; but the planets that follow a straight path at their rising keep their light for a longer tract and those that follow a slanting path pass in a swifter period.
