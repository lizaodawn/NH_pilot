charax is a city situate at the furthest extremity of the arabian gulf, at which begins the more prominent portion of arabia felix: it is built on an artificial elevation, having the tigris on the right, and the eulaeus on the left, and lies on a piece of ground three miles in extent, just between the confluence of those streams. it was first founded by alexander the great, with colonists from the royal city of durine, which was then destroyed, and such of his soldiers as were invalided and left behind. by his order it was to be called alexandria, and a borough called pella, from his native place, was to be peopled solely by macedonians; the city, however, was destroyed by inundations of the rivers. antiochus, the fifth king of syria, afterwards rebuilt this place and called it by his own name; and on its being again destroyed, pasines, the son of saggonadacus, and king of the neighbouring arabians, whom juba has incorrectly described as a satrap of king antiochus, restored it, and raised embankments for its protection, calling it after himself. these embankments extended in length a distance of nearly three miles, in breadth a little less. it stood at first at a distance of ten stadia from the shore, and even had a harbour of its own. but according to juba, it is fifty miles from the sea; and at the present day, the ambassadors from arabia, and our own merchants who have visited the place, say that it stands at a distance of one hundred and twenty miles from the sea-shore. indeed, in no part of the world have alluvial deposits been formed more rapidly by the rivers, and to a greater extent than here; and it is only a matter of surprise that the tides, which run to a considerable distance beyond this city, do not carry them back again. at this place was born dionysius, the most recent author of a description of the world; he was sent by the late emperor augustus to gather all necessary information in the east, when his eldest son was about to set out for armenia to take the command against the parthians and arabians.
