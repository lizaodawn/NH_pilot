historical record also exists of thunderbolts being either caused by or vouchsafed in answer to certain rites and prayers. there is an old story of the latter in etruria, when the portent which they called olta came to the city of bolsena, when its territory had been devastated; it was sent in answer to the prayer of its king porsina. also before his time, as is recorded on the reliable authority of lucius piso in his annals i, this was frequently practised by numa, though when tullus hostilius copied him with incorrect ritual he was struck by lightning. we also have groves and altars and rites, and among the other jupiters, the stayers and thunderers and receivers of offerings, tradition gives us jupiter the invoked. on this matter the opinion of mankind varies, in correspondence with our individual dispositions. it takes a bold man to believe that nature obeys the behests of ritual, and equally it takes a dull man to deny that ritual has beneficent powers, when knowledge has made such progress even in the interpretation of thunderbolts that it can prophecy that others will come on a fixed day, and whether they will destroy a previous one or other previous ones that are concealed: this progress has been made by public and private experiments in both fields. in consequence although such indications are certain in some cases but doubtful in others, and approved to some persons but in the view of others to be condemned, in accordance with nature's will and pleasure, we for our part are not going to leave out the rest of the things worth recording in this department.
