after the cross-ploughing has been done there follows the harrowing of clods with a framework or a rake where circumstances require it, and, where local custom allows, this second breaking is also repeated after the seed has been sown, by means of a harrow-framework or with a board attached to the plough covering up the seeds — this process is called ridging; if they are not covered, this is 'unridging' — the original use of the word that means 'raving'. virgil when he said that the best crop is one that 'twice hath felt the sun and twice the cold', is understood to have desired a fourth ploughing before sowing. where the soil is rather dense, as it usually is in italy, it is better to plough five times before sowing, but in etruria nine times. with beans and vetch however it is a labour-saving plan involving no loss to dispense with preliminary breaking before sowing.
