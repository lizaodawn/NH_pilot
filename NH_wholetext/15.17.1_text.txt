this department of life has long ago arrived at its highest point, mankind having explored every possibility, inasmuch as virgil speaks of grafting nuts on an arbutus, apples on a plane and cherries on an elm. and nothing further can be devised - at all events it is now a long time since any new kind of fruit has been discovered. moreover, religious scruples do not permit us to cross all varieties by grafting; for instance, we must not graft upon a thorn, inasmuch as it is not easy to expiate thunderbolts when they have struck them, and it is declared that the same number of bolts will strike it in a single flash as the kinds of trees that have been grafted on it.
