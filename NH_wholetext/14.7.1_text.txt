wine has the property of heating the parts of the body inside when it is drunk and of cooling them when poured on them outside. and it will not be out of place to recall here what the famous philosopher androcydes wrote to alexander the great in an attempt to restrain his intemperance: 'when you are about to drink wine, o king, remember that you are drinking the earth's blood. hemlock is poison to a human being and wine is poison to hemlock.' if alexander had obeyed this advice, doubtless he would not have killed his friends in his drunken fits; so that in fact we are justified in saying that there is nothing else that is more useful for strengthening the body, and also nothing more detrimental to our pleasures if moderation be lacking.
