i must not forget to mention one instance of a hearth that is famous in roman literature. it is said that during the reign of tarquinius priscus [616-579 bc] there suddenly emerged from the ashes on his hearth a male genital organ [see dionys. hal. 4.2,1 and plut. de fortuna romanorum 10], and that a captive girl who was sitting there, ocresia, a maidservant of queen tanaquil, rose from there in a state of pregnancy. according to the story, this was how servius tullius, who succeeded to the throne, came to be born. afterwards, and likewise in the king's house, it is said that flames blazed round the child's head as he slept, and that he was therefore believed to be then of the god who protected the household. hence, we are told, he first founded the festival of the crossroads in honour of the gods who protect the community.
