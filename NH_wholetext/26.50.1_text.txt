the same property is to be found in crethmos, a plant very highly praised by hippocrates. it is also one of the wild plants that are eaten — at any rate in callimachus the peasant hecale puts it on the table — and a species of garden elate. it has one stem a span high, and a hot seed, scented like that of libanotis, and round. when dried it bursts, and has inside a white kernel, which some call cachrys. the leaves are fleshy, and whitish like those of the olive only thicker, and salt to the taste; there are three or four roots, of the thickness of a finger. it grows in rocky places by the sea. it is eaten, raw or boiled, with cabbage, and has a pleasant, aromatic taste; it is also preserved in brine. it is especially useful for strangury, the leaves, stem, or root being taken in wine. the complexion also of the skin is improved by it, but too large a dose causes flatulence. a decoction relaxes the bowels, brings away urine and humours from the kidneys, as does the powder of dried alcima taken in wine, and relieves strangury, more efficaciously however if daucum is added. it is also good for the spleen, and is taken in drink for snake bites. phlegm or strangury in draught animals also is relieved if crethsnos is sprinkled over their barley.
