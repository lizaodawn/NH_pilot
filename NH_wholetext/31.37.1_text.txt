because those at sea often suffer from the failure of fresh water, i shall describe ways meeting this difficulty. if spread around a ship, fleeces become moist by absorption of evaporated sea water, and from them can be squeezed water which is fresh. again, hollow wax balls, let down into the sea in nets, or empty vessels with their mouth sealed, collect fresh water inside. but on land sea water is made fresh by filtering through clay. dislocated limbs of both man and quadrupeds are very easily reset by swimming in any kind of water. travellers too are sometimes afraid lest unknown water should endanger their health. a precaution against this danger is to drink the suspected water cold immediately on leaving the bath.
