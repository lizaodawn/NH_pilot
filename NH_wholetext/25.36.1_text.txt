women too have been ambitious to gain this distinction, among them artemisia, the wife of mausolus, who gave her name to a plant which before was called parthenis. there are some who think that the surname is derived from artemis ilithyia, because the plant is specific for the troubles of women. it is also bushy, resembling wormwood, but with larger and fleshy leaves. of the plant itself there are two kinds: one higher and with broader leaves, the other soft and with more slender leaves, growing only near the seaside. there are some who in inland districts call by the same name a plant with a single stem, very small leaves, abundant blossom bursting out when the grapes are ripening, and with a not unpleasant smell. the sort that some call botrys, and others ambrosia, grows in cappadocia.
