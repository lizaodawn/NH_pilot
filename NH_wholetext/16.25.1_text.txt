in the lime-tree the male and the female are entirely different. not only is the wood of the male lime hard and reddish and knotted and more scented, but also the bark is thicker, and when peeled off cannot be bent; nor does the male tree produce seed or a flower as the female does, and the female is thicker in the trunk and its wood is white and of superior quality. a remarkable fact in regard to the lime is that no animal will touch its fruit, whereas the juice of the leaves and bark has a sweet taste. between the bark and the wood there are thin coats made by a number of layers of skin, made from which are the ropes called lime-withies, and the thinnest part of them provided lime-chaplets, famous for the ribbons of wreaths of honour in old times. lime-wood is worm-proof, and it makes useful timber although the tree is of extremely moderate height.
