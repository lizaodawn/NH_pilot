all the other animals are born with teeth, but man grows them six months after birth. all the rest keep their teeth permanently, but man, the lion, the beasts of burden, dogs and ruminant animals shed them; with the lion and dog however this only applies to those called dog-teeth. the right dog-tooth of a wolf is held to be valuable as an amulet. no animal sheds its maxillary teeth, the ones next to the dog-teeth. in man those called wisdom-teeth grow latest, at about the age of twenty, and in many cases even at eighty, with females as well, but only in the case of persons who did not grow them in youth. it is certain that in old age they fall out and then grow again. mucianus has stated that he saw a samothracian named zocles who grew a new set of teeth when 110 years old. for the rest, males have more teeth than females in the case of man, ox, goat and pig. timarchus son of nicocles at paphos had two rows of maxillaries; his brother did not shed his front teeth, and consequently wore them down. there is a case of a person even growing a tooth in the palate. any of the dog teeth lost by some accident never grow again. with all other species the teeth get red in old age, but in the horse alone they become whiter.
