rue also is sown when the west wind blows in spring, and just after the autumn equinox. it hates cold weather, damp and dung, and likes sunny, dry places and a soil containing as much brick-clay as possible; it requires to be manured with ashes, which are also mixed with the seed to banish caterpillars. rue was held in special importance in old times: i find that honied wine flavoured with rue was given to the public by cornelius, quintus flamininus's colleague in the consulship, after the election had been concluded. rue is so friendly with the fig that it grows better under this tree than anywhere else. it can also be grown from a slip, preferably inserted into a hole made in a bean, which holds the slip firmly and nourishes it with its juice. it also reproduces itself by layering, since if the end of a branch curves over, when it touches the ground the plant at once strikes root. basil also has the same properties, except that its seed dries with more difficulty. stubbing rue is a process not without difficulty, because it causes itching ulcers, unless it is done with the hands protected by gloves or safeguarded by oiling. the leaves of rue are also preserved, being kept in bundles.
