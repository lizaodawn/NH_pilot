but among all of these species the chief place belongs to the bees, and this rightly is the species; chiefly admired, because they alone of this genus have been created for the sake of man. they collect honey, that sweetest and most refined and most health-giving of juices, they model combs and wax that serves a thousand practical purposes, they endure toil, they construct works, they have a government and individual enterprises and collective leaders, and, a thing that must occasion most surprise, they have a system of manners that outstrips that of all the other animals, although they belong neither to the domesticated nor to the wild class. nature is so mighty a power that out of what is almost a tiny ghost of an animal she has created something incomparable! what sinews or muscles can we match with such efficacy and industry as that of the bees? what men, i protest, can we rank in rationality with these insects, which unquestionably excel mankind in this, that they recognize only the common interest? not raising the question of breath, suppose we agree as to their possessing even blood; yet what a tiny quantity can there be in these tiny creatures! after these points let us estimate their intelligence.
