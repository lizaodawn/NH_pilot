rabies in dogs, as we have said, is dangerous to human beings in periods when the dog-star is shining, as it causes fatal hydrophobia to those bitten in those circumstances. consequently a precautionary measure during the 30 days in question is to mix dung - mostly chicken's droppings, in the dog's food, or, if the disease has come already, hellebore. but after a bite the only cure is one which was lately discovered from an oracle, the root of the wild-rose called in greek dog-rose. columella states that if a dog's tail is docked by being bitten off and the end joint amputated 40 days after birth, the spinal marrow having been removed the tail does not grow again and the dog is not liable to rabies. the only cases that have come down to us among portents, so far as i have noted of a dog talking and a snake barking when tarqum was driven from his kingdom.
