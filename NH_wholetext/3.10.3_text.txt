at this spot ends the first great gulf of europe; the seas in which bear the following names: â€” that from which it takes its rise is called the atlantic, by some the great atlantic, the entrance of which is, by the greeks, called porthmos, by us the straits of gades. after its entrance, as far as it washes the coasts of spain, it is called the hispanian sea, though some give it the name of the iberian or balearic sea. where it faces the province of gallia narbonensis it has the name of the gallic, and after that, of the ligurian, sea. from liguria to the island of sicily, it is called the tuscan sea, the same which is called by some of the greeks the notian, by others the tyrrhenian sea, while many of our people call it the lower sea. beyond sicily, as far as the country of the salentini, it is styled by polybius the ausonian sea. eratosthenes however gives to the whole expanse that lies between the inlet of the ocean and the island of sardinia, the name of the sardoan sea; thence to sicily, the tyrrhenian sea; thence to crete, the sicilian; and beyond that island, the cretan sea.
