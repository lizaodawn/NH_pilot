first therefore let us state the reason why venus never departs more than 46 degrees and mercury never more than 23 degrees from the sun, and why they often retire and return towards the sun within those limits. as situated below the sun both have arcs that are the opposite of those of the other planets, and as much of their circle is below the earth as that of the planets mentioned before is above it; and they cannot be further from it than they are because the curve of their arcs does not allow greater elongation there; consequently the edges of their arcs put a limit on a similar principle for each, and compensate for the dimensions of their longitude by the enlargement of their latitude. but, it will be objected, why do they not reach 46 and 23 degrees always? as a matter of fact they do, but the explanation escapes the theorists. for it is manifest that even their arcs alter, because they never cross the sun; accordingly when the edges have fallen on one side or the other into the actual degree of the sun, then the stars also are understood to have reached their longest distances, but when the edges are short of that, they themselves too are compelled to return with proportionately greater velocity, since with each of them that is always the extreme limit.
