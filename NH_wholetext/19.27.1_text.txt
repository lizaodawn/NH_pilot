the rest of the plants that we have placed in the cartilaginous class are of a woodier substance, and it is noticeable that they all have an extremely pungent taste. among these there is one wild kind of parsnip that grows of its own accord, and another kind belonging to greece that is grown from a root or from seed set at the beginning of spring or else in autumn, according to hyginus, in february or in august or september or october, the ground having been dug over as deeply as possible. a root only a year old begins to be serviceable, but a two year old plant is more valuable; it is more agreeable in autumn, and especially for boiling in saucepans, and even so it has a pungency that cannot be got rid of. the marsh-mallow differs from the parsnip in being of a more slender shape; it is condemned as an article of diet, but is useful for medical purposes. there is also a fourth kind of plant that bears the same resemblance to a parsnip, which our people call the gallic parsnip, but the greeks, who have subdivided it also into four classes, call daucos; this will have to be mentioned among the medicinal plants.
