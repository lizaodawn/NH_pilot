in the district of thrace inland from amphipolis men and hawks have a sort of partnership for fowling: the men put up the birds from woods and reed-beds and the hawks flying overhead drive them down again; the fowlers share the bag with the hawks. it is reported that when the birds have been put up the hawks intercept them in the air, and when it is time for a catch invite the sportsmen to take the opportunity by their screaming and their way of flying. wolf-fish at the maeotic marsh act somewhat in the same way, for unless they get their share from fishermen they tear their nets when spread.
