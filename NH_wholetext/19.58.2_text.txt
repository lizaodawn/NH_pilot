in regard to the deterioration of seeds, some keep longer than others, for instance coriander, beet, leek, cress, mustard, rocket, savory and the pungent seeds generally; while the seeds of orage, basil, gourd and cucumber do not keep so well, and summer seeds in general are not so strong as winter ones. the least lasting is long-onion seed. of these however which keep best none is of any use after four years, at all events for sowing; they are fit for kitchen use even beyond that period.
