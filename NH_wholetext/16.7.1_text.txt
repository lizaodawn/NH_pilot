the acorn of the beech resembles a kernel, being enclosed in a triangular shell. the leaf, which is thin and one of the lightest that there are, resembles that of the poplar; it turns yellow very quickly, and on its upper side, usually at the middle, it grows a little green berry with a pointed end. mice are extremely fond of the beech and consequently in places where it grows these animals abound; it also fattens dormice, and is good for thrushes, too. almost all trees grow a good crop only every other year, but this is especially the case with the beech.
