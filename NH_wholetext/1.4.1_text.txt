my own presumption has indeed gone further, in dedicating to you the present volumes — a work of a lighter nature, as it does not admit of talent, of which in any case i possessed only quite a moderate amount, nor does it allow of digressions, nor of speeches or dialogues, nor marvellous accidents or unusual occurrences — matters interesting to relate or entertaining to read. my subject is a barren one — the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian, words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor one in which the mind is eager to range: there is not one person to be found among us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject. a large part of us seek agreeable fields of study, while topics of immeasurable abstruseness treated by others are drowned in the shadowy darkness of the theme. deserving of treatment before all things are the subjects included by the greeks under the name of 'encyclic culture'; and nevertheless they are unknown, or have been obscured by subtleties, whereas other subjects have been published so widely that they have become stale. it is a difficult task to give novelty to what is old, authority to what is new, brilliance to the commonplace, light to the obscure, attraction to the stale, credibility to the doubtful, but nature to all things and all her properties to nature. accordingly, even if we have not succeeded, it is honourable and glorious in the fullest measure to have resolved on the attempt.
