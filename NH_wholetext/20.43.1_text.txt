wild asparagus is called by some corruda, by others libyan, by the attics orminus. for all the purposes mentioned above its properties are more efficacious than those of the cultivated asparagus, and those of the whiter kind are the more powerful. both relieve jaundice. as an aphrodisiac, the water in which it has been boiled is recommended to be drunk in doses up to a hemina. its seed has the same effect mixed with dill and taken in doses of three oboli of each. a decoction of the juice is also given for the bites of serpents. its root, mixed with the root of fennel, is among our most efficacious aids. in cases of haematuria the seed of asparagus, of parsley, and of cummin is prescribed by chrysippus in doses of three oboli in two cyathi of wine. he goes on to say that thus prepared, although it is diuretic, yet it is bad for dropsy, as it is for venery, and also for the bladder unless it is boiled in water; that this water kills dogs if they drink it; that the juice of the root boiled in wine, if it be held in the mouth, cures toothache.
