hydromel is also said to be useful for coughs, but when warmed it provokes vomiting. with oil it is beneficial in eases of white-lead poisoning, also with milk, especially asses' milk, for henbane, and, as i have said, for poisoning by halicacabum. it is poured into the ears, and into fistulas of the genitals. it is applied with soft bread to the uterus, to sudden swellings, to sprains and to all complaints needing soothing treatment. the use of matured hydromel has been condemned by recent authorities as being less harmless than water and keeping less well than wine. when however it has been kept for a long time, it turns into a wine which, as all are agreed, is most injurious to the stomach and bad for the sinews.
