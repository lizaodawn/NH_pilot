some birds have toes, others are web-footed, and others intermediate, with separate toes but also broad feet; but all have four toes, three in front and one at the heel â€” the latter however absent in some long-legged species; the wry-neck alone has two toes on either side of the foot. the same bird has a tongue like a snake's which it stretches out a long way, and it turns its neck round towards its back; it has large claws like a jay's. some of the heavier birds, though none of those with crooked talons, have spurs added on the legs. the long-legged birds fly with their legs extended towards their tail, but the short-legged ones draw them into their middle. those who say that there is no bird without feet assert that black martins have specially short feet, and also the alpine swift, a bird that is very rarely seen. even snakes with the feet of geese have been seen before now.
