all these kinds of trees when set fire to make an enormous quantity of sooty smoke and suddenly with an explosive crackle send out a splutter of charcoal and shoot it to a considerable distance â€” excepting the larch, which does not burn nor yet make charcoal, nor waste away from the action of fire any more than do stones. all these trees are evergreen, and are not easily distinguishable in point of foliage even by experts, so closely are they interrelated; but the pitch-pine is not so tall as the larch, which has a thicker and smoother bark and more velvety and oilier and thicker foliage, the leaf bending more softly to the touch, whereas the foliage of the pitch-pine is scantier and also drier and thinner and of a colder nature, and the whole tree is rougher and is covered with resin; the wood more resembles that of the fir. when the roots of a larch have been burnt it does not throw out fresh shoots, but the pitch-pine does, as happened on the island of lesbos after the grove of the town of pyrrha had been burnt. moreover there is another difference within these species themselves in the matter of sex: the male tree is shorter and has harder leaves, while the female is taller and its leaves are more unctuous and not forked and not stiff; and the wood of the male is hard, and when used in carpentry splits crooked, while that of the female is softer, the manifestation of the difference resting with the axe, which in every variety detects the male, because it meets with resistance and falls with a louder crash and is pulled out of the wood with greater difficulty. with the male trees the wood itself is parched and blacker in colour. in the neighbourhood of mount ida in the troad there is also another variation among the larches, the mountain larch and the coast larch being different. as for macedonia and arcadia and the neighbourhood of elis, in these places the varieties exchange names and the authorities are not agreed as to which name to give to each species, though for our part we settle that sort of question by the verdict of rome.
