isauria and the homonades: all the geographers have mentioned pamphylia as joining up to cilicia, without taking any notice of the people of isauria. its cities are, in the interior, isaura, clibanus, and lalasis; it runs down towards the sea by the side of anemurium already mentioned. in a similar manner also, all who have treated of this subject have been ignorant of the existence of the nation of the homonades bordering upon isauria, and their town of homona in the interior. there are forty-four other fortresses, which lie concealed amid rugged crags and valleys.
