the cause of the birth of new lands is the same, when that same breath although powerful enough to cause an upheaval of the soil has not been able to force an exit. for lands are born not only through the conveyance of soil by streams (as the echinades islands when heaped up from the river achelous and the greater part of egypt from the nile â€” the crossing from the island of pharos to the coast, if we believe homer, having formerly taken twenty-four hours) or by the retirement of the sea as once took place at circei; such a retirement is also recorded to have occurred to a distance of 10,000 paces in the harbour of ambracia, and to a distance of 5,000 at the athenian port of piraeus; and at ephesus, where once the sea used to wash up to the temple of diana. at all events if we believe herodotus, there was sea above memphis as far as the mountains of ethiopia and also towards the plains of arabia, and sea round ilium, and over the whole territory of teuthras and where the maeander has spread prairie-land.
