if it is felt that the bees are in need of food, it would be well to place at the door raisins or crushed dried figs, as well as carded wool soaked in raisin wine, boiled-down must or hydromel, as well as the hare flesh of poultry. in some summers also, when continued drought has deprived the bees of their food from flowers, the same kinds of food must be supplied to them. when the honey is taken out, the exit of the hive should be smeared with crushed melissophyllum or greenweed, or the middle should be lined with white vine, to prevent the bees from flying away. honey pots and combs are recommended to be washed with water; this when boiled down is said to make a very wholesome vinegar.
