kites belong to the same genus as hawks but differ in size. it has been noticed in regard to this species. that though a most rapacious bird and always hungry it never steals any edible from the oblations at funerals nor from the altar at olympia and not even out of the hands of the people bringing the offsprings except with a gloomy portent for the slaves performing the sacrifice. also it seems that this bird by its manipulation of its tail taught the art of steersmanship, nature demonstrating in the sky what was required in the deep. kites themselves also are not seen in the winter months, though not departing before the swallow; it is reported however that they suffer from gout even from midsummer onward.
