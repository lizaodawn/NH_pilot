couferva is peculiar to running streams, alpine in particular, so named from confer-vamainare, to solder together. it is more like a freshwater sponge than a moss or vascular plant, being a hairy, dense, and porous mass. to my knowledge a man who, pruning a very high tree, fell and broke nearly all his bones, was treated with this plant. his entire body was enveloped in it; whenever it dried it was sprinkled with its native water but rarely taken off, only in fact for renewals when the plant lost its strength. the patient recovered in an almost incredibly short time.
