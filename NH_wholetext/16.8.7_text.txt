beech-mast fed to pigs livens them up, and makes their flesh easy to cook and light and digestible whereas the acorns of the holm-oak make a pig thin, not a glossy, meagre. acorns from the common oak make it heavy and lumpish, being themselves also the largest of nuts and the sweetest in flavour. according to nigidius's account the next best to the common acorn is the acorn of the turkey oak, and no other kind gives the pig more solid flesh, though hard. he says that holm-oak acorn is a trying feed for pigs, unless given to them in small quantities at a time; and that this is the latest acorn to fall. he adds that the acorn of the winter oak, hard-oak and cork-tree make a pig's flesh spongy.
