next after these we will speak about laser-wort, a remarkably important plant, the greek name for which is silphium; it was originally found in the province of cyrenaica. its juice is called laser, and it takes an important place in general use and among drugs, and is sold for its weight in silver denarii. it has not been found in that country now for many years, because the tax-farmers who rent the pasturage strip it clean by grazing sheep on it, realizing that they make more profit in that way. only a single stalk has been found there within our memory, which was sent to the emperor nero. if a grazing flock ever chances to come on a promising young shoot, this is detected by the indication that a sheep after eating it at once goes to sleep and a goat has a fit of sneezing. and for a long time now no laser-wort has been imported to us except what grows in persia or media and armenia, in abundant quantity but much inferior quality to that of cyrenaica, and even so adulterated with gum, sacopenium, or with crushed beans; this makes it even more necessary for us not to omit to state the facts that in the consulship of gaius valerius and marcus herennius, 30 pounds of laser-wort plant was imported to rome by the government, and that during the dictatorship of caesar, at the beginning of the civil war he produced out of the treasury together with gold and silver 1500 lbs. of laser-wort plant.
