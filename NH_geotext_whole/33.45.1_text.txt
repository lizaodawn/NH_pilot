it has been believed that only the best silver is capable of being beaten out into plates and producing an image. this was formerly a sound test, but nowadays this too is spoiled by fraud. still, the property of reflecting images is marvellous; it is generally agreed that it takes place owing to the repercussion of the air which is thrown back into the eyes. in a similar way, owing to the same force, in employing a mirror if the thickness of the metal has been polished and beaten out into a slightly concave shape the size of the objects reflected is enormously magnified: such a difference does it make whether the surface welcomes the air in question or flings it back. moreover bowls can be made of such a shape, with a number of looking-glasses so to speak beaten outward inside them, that if only a single person is looking into them a crowd of images is formed of the same number as the facets in question. ingenuity even devises vessels that do conjuring tricks, for instance those deposited as votive offerings in the temple at smyrna: this is brought about by the shape of the material, and it makes a very great difference whether the vessels are concave and shaped like a bowl or convex like a thracian shield, whether their centre is recessed or projecting, whether the oval is horizontal or oblique, laid flat or placed upright, as the quality of the shape receiving the shadows twists them as they come: for in fact the image in a mirror is merely the shadow arranged by the brilliance of the material receiving it. and in order to complete the whole subject of mirrors in this place, the best of those known in old days were those made at brindisi of a mixture of stagnum and copper. silver mirrors have come to be preferred; they were first made by pasiteles in the period of pompey the great. but it has recently come to be believed that a more reliable reflection is given by applying a layer of gold to the back of glass.
