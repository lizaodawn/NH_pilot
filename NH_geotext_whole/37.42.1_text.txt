besides the 'hyacinthus,' the 'chrysolithus,' a bright golden, transparent stone, comes to us from ethiopia. preference over this variety, however, goes to the indian and, if the colour is uniform, to the tibarene stones! the worst stones are the arabian, for these are murky and mottled, with their brilliance broken up by cloudy spots. even the clear stones that have come to light are full of a kind of powder. the best specimens are those which, placed alongside gold, make it assume a white, silvery appearance. these stones are set in an open bezel so as to remain fully transparent, while the rest are backed with brass foil.
