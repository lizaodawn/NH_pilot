another more important reason for its value is that it gets extremely little worn by use; whereas, with silver, copper and lead, lines may be drawn, and stuff that comes off them dirties the hand. nor is any other material more malleable or able to be divided into more portions, seeing that an ounce of gold can be beaten out into 750 or more leaves 4 inches square. the thickest kind of gold leaf is called praeneste leaf, still bearing the name taken from the faithfully gilded statue of fortune in that place. the foil next in thickness is styled quaestorian leaf. in spain tiny pieces of gold are called scrapers. gold more than all other metals is found unalloyed in nuggets or in the form of detritus. whereas all other metals when found in the mines are brought into a finished condition by means of fire, gold is gold straight away and has its substance in a perfect state at once, when it is obtained by mining. this is the natural way of getting it, while another which we shall describe is artificial. more than any other substance gold is immune from rust or verdigris or anything else emanating from it that wastes its goodness or reduces its weight. moreover in steady resistance to the overpowering effect of the juices of salt and vinegar it surpasses all things, and over and above that it can be spun into thread and woven into a fabric like wool, even without an addition of wool. verrius informs us that tarquinius priscus celebrated a triumph wearing a golden tunic. we have in our own times seen the emperor claudius's wife agrippina, at a show at which he was exhibiting a naval battle, seated at his side wearing a military cloak made entirely of cloth of gold. for a long period gold has been woven into the fabric called cloth of attalus, an invention of kings of asia.
