ravens produce broods of five at most. there is a popular belief that they lay eggs, or else mate, with the beak (and that consequently if women with child eat a raven's egg they bear the infant through the mouth, and that altogether they have a difficult delivery if raven's eggs are brought into the house); but aristotle says that this is not true of the raven, any more indeed than it is of the ibis in egypt, but that the billing in question (which is often noticed) is a form of kissing, like that which takes place between pigeons. ravens seem to be the only birds that have an understanding of the meanings that they convey in auspices; for when the guests of medus were murdered, all the ravens in the peloponnese and attica flew away. it is a specially bad omen when they gulp down their croak as if they were choking.
