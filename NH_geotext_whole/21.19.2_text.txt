the pisidian variety, too, is by no means despised. those who are going to dig it up pour hydromel around it three months previously. this is as it were a libation to please the earth. then they draw three circles round it with the point of a sword, gather it and at once raise it heavenwards. it is hot by nature, and when handled raises blisters like those of a burn. it is especially enjoined that those who gather it should be chaste. not only when dried, but also when in the ground, it is very easily subject to worms. previously the best iris oil used to be brought from leucas and elis - for it has been planted there a long time - now the best comes from pamphylia, but the cilician too is highly praised, as is also that coming from the northern parts.
