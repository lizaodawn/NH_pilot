the earth of ebusus has the effect of driving away serpents, while that of colubraria produces them; hence the latter spot is dangerous to all persons who have not brought with them some of the earth of ebusus. the greeks have given it the name of ophiusa. ebusus too produces no rabbits to destroy the harvests of the baleares. there are also about twenty other small islands in this sea, which is full of shoals. off the coast of gaul, at the mouth of the rhodanus, there is metina, and near it the island which is known as blascon, with the three stoechades, so called by their neighbours the massilians, on account of the regular order in which they are placed; their respective names are prote, mese, also called pomponiana, and hypaea. after these come sturium, phoenice, phila, lero, and, opposite to antipolis, lerina, where there is a remembrance of a town called vergoanum having once existed.
