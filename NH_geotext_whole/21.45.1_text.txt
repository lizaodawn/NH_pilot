there is another kind of honey, found in the same district of pontus among the people called sanni, which from the madness it produces is called maenomenon. this poison is supposed to be extracted from the flowers of the oleanders which abound in the woods. though these people supply the romans with wax by way of tribute, the honey, because of its deadly nature, they do not sell. in persis, too, and in gaetulia of mauretania caesariensis, bordering on the massaesyli, are found poisoned honeycombs, sometimes only in part such, a more deceptive limitation than anything else could be, were it not that the livid colour makes detection easy. what are we to think that nature meant by these traps; that they should not occur every year, and not in the whole of the comb, and yet be due to the same bees? was it not enough to have produced a substance in which it was very easy to administer poison? did nature also administer it herself in the honey to so many living creatures? what did she mean, except to make man more careful and less greedy? for had she not already bestowed upon the bees themselves a spear, and that a poisoned one, so that a cure for this poison must be given most assuredly without delay? accordingly, it is healing to apply to the sting the juice of the mallow or of ivy leaves, or for the stung persons to take these in drink. yet it is wonderful that the bees, carrying poison in their mouths and working it, do not themselves die, unless it be that the great mistress of all things has given bees this immunity, as she has given immunity against snakebite to the psylli and to the marsi among men.
