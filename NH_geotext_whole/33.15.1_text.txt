it does indeed surprise me that the roman nation always imposed a tribute of silver, not of gold, on races that it conquered, for instance on carthage when conquered together with hannibal, 800,000 [202 bc] pounds weight of silver in yearly instalments of 16,000 pounds spread over 50 years, but no gold. nor can it be considered that this was due to the world's poverty. midas and croesus had already possessed wealth without limit, and cyrus had already on conquering asia minor found booty consisting of 24,000 [546-5 bc] pounds weight of gold, besides vessels and articles made of gold, including a throne, a plane-tree and a vine. and by this victory he carried off 500,000 talents of silver and the wine-bowl of semiramis the weight of which came to 15 talents. the egyptian talent according to marcus varro amounts to 80 pounds of gold. saulaces the descendant of aeetes had already reigned in colchis, who is said to have come on a tract of virgin soil in the country of the suani and elsewhere and to have dug up from it a great quantity of gold and silver, his realm being moreover famous for golden fleeces. we are also told of his gold-vaulted ceilings and silver beams and columns and pilasters, belonging to sesostris king of egypt whom saulaces conquered, so proud a monarch that he is reported to have been in the habit every year of harnessing to his chariot individual kings selected by lot from among his vassals and so going in triumphal procession.
