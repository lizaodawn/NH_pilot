once upon a time trees were the temples of the deities, and in conformity with primitive ritual simple country places even now dedicate a tree of exceptional height to a god; nor do we pay greater worship to images shining with gold and ivory than to the forests and to the very silences that they contain. the different kinds of trees are kept perpetually dedicated to their own divinities, for instance, the winter-oak to jove, the bay to apollo, the olive to minerva, the myrtle to venus, the poplar to hercules; nay, more, we also believe that the silvani and fauns and various kinds of goddesses are as it were assigned to the forests from heaven and as their own special divinities. subsequently it was the trees with juices more succulent than corn that gave mellowness to man; for from frees are obtained olive oil to refresh the limbs and draughts of wine to restore the strength, and in fine all the savours that come by the spontaneous generosity of the year, and the fruits that are even now served as a second course, in spite of the fact that battle must be waged with the wild beasts to obtain them and that fishes fattened on the corpses of shipwrecked mariners are in demand. moreover, there are a thousand other uses for those trees which are indispensable for carrying on life. we use a tree to furrow the seas and to bring the lands nearer together, we use a tree for building houses; even the images of the deities were made from trees, before men had yet thought of paying a price for the corpses of huge animals, or arranged that inasmuch as the privilege of luxury had originated from the gods, we should behold the countenances of the deities and the legs of our tables made of the same ivory. it is stated that the gauls, imprisoned as they were by the alps as by a then insuperable bulwark, first found a motive for overflowing into italy from the circumstance that a gallic citizen from switzerland named helico, who had sojourned at rome on account of his skill as an artificer, had brought with him when he came back some dried figs and grapes and some samples of oil and wine; and consequently we may pardon them for having sought to obtain these things even by means of war.
