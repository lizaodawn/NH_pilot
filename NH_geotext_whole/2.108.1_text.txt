in samosata the city of commagene there is a marsh that produces an inflammable mud called mineral pitch. when this touches anything solid it sticks to it; also when people touch it, it actually follows them as they try to get away from it. by these means they defended the city walls when attacked by lucullus: the troops kept getting burnt by their own weapons. water merely makes it burn more fiercely; experiments have shown that it can only be put out by earth.
