i may premise by observing that this land very much resembles in shape an oak leaf, being much longer than it is broad; towards the top it inclines to the left, while it terminates in the form of an amazonian buckler, in which the spot at the central projection is the place called cocinthos, while it sends forth two horns at the end of its crescent-shaped bays, leucopetra on the right and lacinium on the left. it extends in length 1020 miles, if we measure from the foot of the alps at praetoria augusta, through the city of rome and capua to the town of rhegium, which is situate on the shoulder of the peninsula, just at the bend of the neck as it were. the distance would be much greater if measured to lacinium, but in that case the line, being drawn obliquely, would incline too much to one side. its breadth is variable; being 410 miles between the two seas, the lower and the upper, and the rivers varus and arsia: at about the middle, and in the vicinity of the city of rome, from the spot where the river aternus flows into the adriatic sea, to the mouth of the tiber, the distance is 136 miles, and a little less from castrum-novum on the adriatic sea to alsium on the tuscan; but in no place does it exceed 200 miles in breadth. the circuit of the whole, from the varus to the arsia, is 3059 miles.
