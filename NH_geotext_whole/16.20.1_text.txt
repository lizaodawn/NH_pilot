moreover, not to pass over any variety, resembling these trees in appearance is the yew, hardly green at all in colour and slender in form, with a gloomy, terrifying appearance; it has no sap, and is the only tree of all the class that bears berries. the fruit of the male yew is harmful - in fact its berries, particularly in spain, contain a deadly poison; even wine-flasks for travellers made of its wood in gaul are known to have caused death. sextius says that the greek name for this tree is milax, and that in arcadia its poison is so active that people who go to sleep or picnic beneath a yew-tree die. some people also say that this is why poisons were called 'taxic,' which we now pronounce 'toxic,' meaning 'used for poisoning arrows.' i find it stated that a yew becomes harmless if a copper nail is driven into the actual tree.
