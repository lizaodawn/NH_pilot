istria, its people and locality: istria projects in the form of a peninsula. some writers have stated its length to be forty miles, and its circumference 125; and the same as to liburnia which adjoins it, and the flanatic gulf, while others make it 225; others again make the circumference of liburnia 180 miles. some persons too extend iapydia, at the back of istria, as far as the flanatic gulf, a distance of 130 miles, thus making liburnia but 150 miles. tuditanus, who subdued the istri, had this inscription on his statue which was erected there: "from aquileia to the river titus is a distance of 1000 stadia."
