i notice that the use of purple at rome dates from the earliest times, but that romulus used it only for a cloak; as it is fairly certain that the first of the kings to use the bordered robe and broader purple stripe was tullus hostilius, after the conquest of the etruscans. cornelius nepos, who died in the principate of the late lamented augustus, says: 'in my young days the violet purple dye was the vogue, a pound of which sold at 100 denarii; and not much later the red purple of taranto. this was followed by the double-dyed tyrian purple, which it was impossible to buy for 1000 denarii per pound. this was first used in a bordered robe by publius lentulus spinther, curule aedile, but met with disapproval, though who does not use this purple for covering dining-couches now-a-days?' spinther was aedile in the consulship of cicero, 63 bc. stuff dipped twice over used at that time to be termed 'double-dyed,' and was regarded as a lavish extravagance, but now almost all the more agreeable purple stuffs are dyed in this way.
