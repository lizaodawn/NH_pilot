and now to resume: the gemstone displayed as that of polycrates is in its natural state, unmarked by engravings. in the time of ismenias, many years later, it seems evident that it had become customary to engrave even 'smaragdi.' this impression is supported, moreover, by an edict of alexander the great forbidding his likeness to be engraved on this stone by anyone except pyrgoteles, who was undoubtedly the most brilliant artist in this field. next to him in fame have been apollonides, cronius and the man who made the excellent likeness of augustus of revered memory which his successors have used as their seal, namely dioscurides. sulla as dictator always used a signet representing the surrender of jugurtha. we learn from our authorities also that the native of intercatia, whose father had been slain by scipio aemilianus after challenging him to single combat, used a signet representing this fight. hence the familiar witticism made by stilo praeconinus, who remarked, 'what would he have done if scipio had been killed by his father?' augustus of revered memory at the beginning of his career used a signet engraved with a sphinx, having found among his mother's rings two such signets which were so alike as to be indistinguishable. during the civil wars, one of these was used by his personal advisers, whenever he himself was absent, for signing any letters and proclamations which the circumstances required to be despatched in his name. the recipients used to make a neat joke saying 'the sphinx brings its problems.' of course, the frog signet belonging to maecenas was also greatly feared because of the contributions of money that it demanded. in later years augustus, wishing to avoid insulting comments about the sphinx, signed his documents with a likeness of alexander the great.
