all water is sweeter in winter, in summer less so, in autumn least, and less during droughts. the taste of rivers is usually variable, owing to the great difference in river beds. for waters vary with the land over which they flow, and with the juices of the plants they wash. therefore the same rivers are found in some parts to be unwholesome. tributaries too alter the flavour of a river, as do those of the borysthenes, and being absorbed are diluted. some rivers indeed are also changed by rain. three times it has happened in the bosphorus that salt rains fell and ruined the crops, and three times rains have made bitter the inundations of the nile, a great plague for egypt.
