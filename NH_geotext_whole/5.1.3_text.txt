in the interior, at a distance of forty miles from lixos, is babba, surnamed julia campestris, another colony of augustus; and, at a distance of seventy-five, a third, called banasa, with the surname of valentia. at a distance of thirty-five miles from this last is the town of volubilis, which is just that distance also from both seas. on the coast, at a distance of fifty miles from lixos, is the river subur, which flows past the colony of banasa, a fine river, and available for the purposes of navigation. at the same distance from it is the city of sala, situate on a river which bears the same name, a place which stands upon the very verge of the desert, and though infested by troops of elephants, is much more exposed to the attacks of the nation of the autololes, through whose country lies the road to mount atlas, the most fabulous locality even in africa.
