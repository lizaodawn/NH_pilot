night birds also have hooked talons, for instance the little owl, the eagle-owl and the screech-owl. all of these are dim-sighted in the daytime. the eagle-owl is a funereal bird, and is regarded as an extremely bad omen, especially at public auspices; it inhabits deserts and places that are not merely unfrequented but terrifying and inaccessible; a weird creature of the night, its cry is not a musical note but a scream. consequently when seen in cities or by daylight in any circumstances it is a direful portent; but i know several cases of its having perched on the houses of private persons without fatal consequences. it never flies in the direction where it wants to go, but travels slantwise out of its course. in the consulship of sextus palpellius hister and lucius pedanius an eagle-owl entered the very shrine of the capitol, on account of which a purification of the city was held on march 7th in that year.
