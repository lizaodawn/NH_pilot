there is another cretaceous earth called silversmiths' powder as used for polishing silver; but the most inferior kind is the one which our ancestors made it the practice to use for tracing the line indicating victory in circus-races and for marking the feet of slaves on sale that had been imported from overseas; instances of these being publilius of antioch the founder of our mimic stage and his cousin manilius antiochus the originator of our astronomy, and likewise staberius eros our first grammarian, all of whom our ancestors saw brought over in the same ship. but why need anybody mention these men, recommended to notice as they are by their literary honours? other instances that have been seen on the stand in the slave market are chrysogonus, freedman of sulla, amphion, freedman of quintus catulus, hector, freedman of lucius lucullus, demetrius, freedman of pompey, and auge, freedwoman of demetrius, although she herself also was believed to have belonged to pompey; hipparchus freedman of mark antony, menas and menecrates freedmen of sextus pompeius, and a list of others whom this is not the occasion to enumerate, who have enriched themselves by the bloodshed of roman citizens and by the licence of the proscriptions. such is the mark set on these herds of slaves for sale, and the disgrace attached to us by capricious fortune persons whom even we have seen risen to such power that we actually beheld the honour of the praetorship awarded to them by decree of the senate at the bidding of claudius caesar's wife agrippina and all but sent back with the rods of office wreathed in laurels to the places from which they came to rome with their feet whitened with white earth.
