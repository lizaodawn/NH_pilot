the first statue publicly erected at rome by foreigners was that in honour of the tribune of the people gaius aelius, for having introduced a law against sthennius stallius the lucanian who had twice made an attack upon thurii; for this the inhabitants of that place presented aelius with a statue and a crown of gold. the same people afterwards presented fabricius with a statue for having rescued them from a state of siege; and various races successively in some such way placed themselves under roman patronage, and all discrimination was so completely abrogated that even a statue of hannibal may be seen in three places in the city within the walls of which he alone of its national foes had hurled a spear.
