after passing the mouth of the bosporus we come to the river rhebas, by some writers called the rhesus. we next come to psillis, the port of calpas, and the sagaris, a famous river, which rises in phrygia and receives the waters of other rivers of vast magnitude, among which are the tembrogius and the gallus, the last of which is by many called the sangarius. after leaving the sagaris the gulf of the mariandyni begins, and we come to the town of heraclea, on the river lycus; this place is distant from the mouth of the euxine two hundred miles. the sea-port of acone comes next, which has a fearful notoriety for its aconite or wolf's-bane, a deadly poison, and then the cavern of acherusia, the rivers paedopides, callichorus, and sonautes, the town of tium, distant from heraclea thirty-eight miles, and the river billis.
