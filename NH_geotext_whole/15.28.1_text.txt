the flesh of the ground strawberry is different from that of the strawberry-tree which is related to it, the strawberry being the only fruit that grows at the same time on a bush and on the ground. the tree itself is a sort of shrub; the fruit takes a year to mature, and the following crop flowers side by side with the earlier crop when it is ripening. authorities disagree as to whether it is the male plant or the female that is unproductive. the fruit is held in no esteem, the reason for its name being that a person will eat only one. nevertheless the greeks call it by the two names of comaron and memaceylon, which shows that there are two varieties of the plant; and with ourselves it has another name, the arbutus. juba states that in arabia the strawberry-tree grows to a height of 75 feet.
