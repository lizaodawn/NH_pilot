we will begin then with the nation of the cappadocians. of all the countries of pontus, this extends the greatest distance into the interior. on the left it leaves behind the lesser and the greater armenia, as well as commagene, and on the right all the nations of the province of asia which we have previously described. spreading over numerous peoples, it rises rapidly in elevation in an easterly direction towards the range of taurus. then passing lycaonia, pisidia, and cilicia, it advances above the district of antiochia, the portion of it known as cataonia extending as far as cyrrhestica, which forms part of that district. the length of asia here is twelve hundred and fifty miles, its breadth six hundred and forty.
