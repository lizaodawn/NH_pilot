the cleverness of horses is beyond description. mounted javelin men experience their docility in assisting difficult attempts with the actual swaying of their body; also they gather up the weapons lying on the ground and pass them to their rider. horses harnessed to chariots in the circus unquestionably show that they understand the shouts of encouragement and applause. at the races in the circus forming part of the secular games of claudius caesar a charioteer of the whites named raven was thrown at the start, and his team took the lead and kept it by getting in the way of their rivals and jostling them aside and doing everything against them that they would have had to do with a most skilful charioteer in control, and as they were ashamed for human science to be beaten by horses, when they had completed the proper course they stopped dead at the chalk line. a greater portent was when in early days a charioteer was thrown at the plebeian circus races and the horses galloped on to the capitol and raced round the temple three times just the same as if he still stood at the reins; but the greatest was when a chariot-team reached the same place from veii with the palm-branch and wreath after ratumenna who had won at veii had been thrown: an event which subsequently gave its name to the gate. the sarmatians get their horses into training for a long journey by giving them no fodder the day before and only allowing them a small amount of water, and by these means they ride them on a journey of 150 miles without drawing rein.
