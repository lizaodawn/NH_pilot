the seal also resembles the beaver both in its amphibious habits and in its nature. it gets rid of its gall, which is useful for many drugs, by vomiting it up, and also its rennet, a cure for epileptic attacks; it does this because it knows that it is bunted for the sake of these products. theophrastus states that geckoes also slough off their old skin as a snake does, and similarly swallow the slough at once, it being a cure for epilepsy if one snatches it from them. it is also said that their bite is harmless in greece but that they are noxious in sicily.
