the mulberry is one of the latest trees to blossom, but among the first to ripen. the juice of ripe mulberries stains the hand, but the stain can be washed out with the juice of unripe ones. in the case of this tree the devices of the growers have made the least improvement of any, and the mulberry of ostia and that of tivoli do not differ from that of rome by named varieties or by grafting or in any other way except in the size of the fruit. a similar but much firmer berry also grows on brambles.
