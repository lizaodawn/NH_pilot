m. agrippa was of opinion that the length of the whole country of the aethiopians, including the red sea, was two thousand one hundred and seventy miles, and its breadth, including upper egypt, twelve hundred and ninety-seven. some authors again have made the following divisions of its length; from meroe to sirbitum eleven days' sail, from sirbitum to the dabelli fifteen days', and from them to the aethiopian ocean six days' journey. it is agreed by most authors, that the distance altogether, from the ocean to meroe, is six hundred and twenty-five miles, and from meroe to syene, that which we have already mentioned. aethiopia lies from south-east to south-west. situate as it is, in a southern hemisphere, forests of ebony are to be seen of the brightest verdure; and in the midst of these regions there is a mountain of immense height, which overhangs the sea, and emits a perpetual flame. by the greeks this mountain is called theon ochema, and at a distance of four days' sail from it is a promontory, known as hesperu ceras, upon the confines of africa, and close to the hesperiae, an aethiopian nation. there are some writers who affirm that in these regions there are hills of a moderate height, which afford a pleasant shade from the groves with which they are clad, and are the haunts of aegipans and satyrs.
