the race of pygmies have a cessation of hostilities on the departure of the cranes that, as we have said, carry on war with them. it is a vast distance, if one calculates it, over which they come from the eastern sea. they agree together when to start, and they fly high so as to see their route in front of them; they choose a leader to follow, and have some of their number stationed in turns at the end of the line to shout orders and keep the flock together with their cries. at night time they have sentries who hold a stone in their claws, which if drowsiness makes them drop it falls and convicts them of slackness, while the rest sleep with their head tucked under their wing, standing on either foot by turns; but the leader keeps a lookout with neck erect and gives warning. (the same birds when tamed are fond of play, and execute certain circles in a graceful swoop, even one bird at a time). it is certain that when they are going to fly across the black sea they first of all make for the straits between the two promontories of ramsbrow and carambis, and proceed to ballast themselves with sand; and that when they have crossed the middle of the sea they throw away the pebbles out of their claws and, when they have reached the mainland, the sand out of their throats as well. cornelius nepos, who died in the principate of the late lamented augustus, when he wrote that the practice of fattening thrushes was introduced a little before his time, added that storks were more in favour than cranes, although the latter bird is now one of those most in request, whereas nobody will touch the former.
