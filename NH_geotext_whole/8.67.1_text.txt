it is known that in lusitania in the neighbourhood of the town of olisipo and the river tagus mares when a west wind is blowing stand facing towards it and conceive the breath of life and that this produces a foal, and this is the way to breed a very swift colt, but it does not live more than three years. also in spain the gallaic and asturian tribes breed those of the horse kind that we call 'theldones,' though when more of a pony type they are designated 'cobs', which have not the usual paces in running but a smooth trot, straightening the near and offside legs alternately, from which the horses are taught by training to adopt an ambling pace. the horse has nearly the same diseases as mankind, and is also liable to shifting of the bladder, as are all beasts of the draft class.
