and now that we have made a beginning in treating of the marvels of nature, we shall proceed to take them in order, by far the greatest among them being that a plant should spring up and live without having any root. the growths referred to are called truffles; they are enveloped all round with earth and are not strengthened by any fibres or at least filaments, nor yet does the place they grow in show any protuberance or undergo cracks; and they themselves do not stick to the earth, and are actually enclosed in a skin, so that while we cannot say downright that they consist of earth, we cannot call them anything but a callosity of the earth. they usually grow in dry and sandy soils and in places covered with shrubs. they often exceed the size of a quince, even weighing as much as a pound. they are of two kinds, one gritty in texture and unkind to the teeth, and the other devoid of impurities; they also differ in their colour, which is red or black, and the inside is white. the african variety is the most highly spoken of. i do not think it can be easily ascertained whether they grow in size, or whether this blemish of the earth - for they cannot be understood as anything else - forms at once a ball of the size that it is going to be; nor whether they are alive or not, for they decay in the same way as wood does. we know for a fact that when lartius licinius, an official of praetorian rank, was serving as minister of justice at cartagena in spain a few years ago, he happened when biting a truffle to come on a denarius contained inside it, which bent his front teeth; this will clearly show that truffles are lumps of earthy substance balled together. one thing that is certain is that truffles will be found to belong to the class of things that spring up spontaneously and cannot be grown from seed.
