a few facts about the world remain. there are also stars that suddenly come to birth in the heaven itself; of these there are several kinds. the greeks call them 'comets,' in our language 'long-haired stars,' because they have a blood-red shock of what looks like shaggy hair at their top. the greeks also give the name of 'bearded stars' to those from whose lower part spreads a mane resembling a long beard. 'javelin-stars' quiver like a dart; these are a very terrible portent. to this class belongs the comet about which titus imperator caesar in his 5th consulship wrote an account in his famous poem, that being its latest appearance down to the present day. the same stars when shorter and sloping to a point have been called 'daggers'; these are the palest of all in colour, and have a gleam like the flash of a sword, and no rays, which even the quoit-star, which resembles its name in appearance but is in colour like amber, emits in scattered form from its edge. the 'tub-star' presents the shape of a cask, with a smoky light all round it. the 'horned star' has the shape of a horn, like the one that appeared when greece fought the decisive battle of salamis. the 'torch-star' resembles glowing torches, the 'horse-star horses' manes in very rapid motion and revolving in a circle. there also occurs a shining comet whose silvery tresses glow so brightly that it is scarcely possible to look at it, and which displays within it a shape in the likeness of a man's countenance. there also occur 'goat comets,' enringed with a sort of cloud resembling tufts of hair. once hitherto it has happened that a 'mane-shaped' comet changed into a spear; this was in the 108th olympiad [348-345 bce] , auc 408 [346 bc]. the shortest period of visibility on record for a comet is 7 days, the longest 80.
