in fact this is the time to review the outstanding features of medical practices in the days of our fathers. cassius hemina, one of our earliest authorities, asserts that the first physician to come to rome was archagathus, son of lysanias, who migrated from the peloponnesus in the year of the city 535, when lucius aemilius and marcus livius were consuls. he adds that citizen rights were given him, and a surgery at the crossway of acilius was bought with public money for his own use. they say that he was a wound specialist, and that his arrival at first was wonderfully popular, but presently from his savage use of the knife and cautery he was nicknamed 'executioner,' and his profession, with all physicians, became objects of loathing. the truth of this can be seen most plainly in the opinion of marcus cato, whose authority is very little enhanced by his triumph and censorship; so much more comes from his personality. therefore i will lay before my readers his very words.
