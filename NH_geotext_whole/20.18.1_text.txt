since most people confuse the two similar greek names, ïƒî­ïƒîµî»î¹ and ïƒî­ïƒîµî»î¹ (ïƒî¯î»î¹), we have added some account of sili or hartwort, though it is a plant generally known. the best is that of massilia, for its seed is broad and yellow; the next best, the aethiopian, is darker, and the cretan has the strongest smell of all. the root has a pleasant smell, and the seed, it is said, even the vultures eat. when drunk in white wine it is beneficial to man for chronic cough, ruptures and convulsions; likewise for opisthotonic tetanus, affections of the liver, colic and strangury, in doses of two or three spoonfuls. the leaves also are useful because they aid parturition, even that of quadrupeds; it is said that does, when about to give birth, make this their special food. the leaves are also applied to erysipelas, and digestion is much helped if the leaf or seed be eaten after food. it arrests also looseness of bowels in quadrupeds, either pounded and mixed with their drink, or chewed up when they eat their food. it acts as a cure for diseases of oxen, if taken with salt or pounded and injected.
