i have said that leprosy did not occur in italy before the time of pompeius magnus, and that though the plague usually begins on the face, a kind of freckle on the tip of the nose, yet presently the skin dries up over all the body, covered with spots of various colours, and uneven, in places thick, in others thin, in others hard as with rough itch-scab, finally however going black, and pressing the flesh on to the bones, while the toes and fingers swell up. this plague is native to egypt. when kings were attacked, it was a deadly thing for the inhabitants, because the tubs in the baths used to be prepared with warm human blood for its treatment. this disease indeed quickly died out in italy, as also did that called by the ancients gemursa, which appeared between the toes, the very name being now obsolete.
