phidippides's running the 130 miles from athens to sparta in two days was a mighty feat, until the spartan runner anystis and alexander the great's courier philonides ran the 148 miles from sikyon to elis in a day. at the present day indeed we are aware that some men can last out 128 miles in the circus, and that recently in the consulship of fonteius and vipstanus a boy of 8 ran 68 miles between noon and evening. the marvellous nature of this feat will only get across to us in full measure if we reflect that tiberius nero completed by carriage the longest twenty-four hours' journey on record when hastening to germany to his brother drusus who was ill: this measured 182 miles.
