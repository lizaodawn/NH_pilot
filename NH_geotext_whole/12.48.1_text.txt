the scented reed which also grows in arabia is shared with the indies and syria, the one growing in the latter country being superior to all the other kinds. about 17 miles from the mediterranean, between mount lebanon and another range of no importance - not counter- lebanon as some have supposed - there is a moderately wide valley near a lake the shallow parts of which dry up in summer, where 3 1/2 miles from the lake the scented reed and scented rush grow. for clearly we may speak about the rush also, although i have devoted another volume to herbaceous plants, as here we are only dealing with plants that supply material for unguents. these plants then do not differ at all in appearance from the rest of their class, but the reed has a specially fine scent which attracts people even from a long way off, and is softer to the touch; the better variety is the one that is less brittle and that breaks in splinters rather than like a radish. inside the tube there is a sort of cobweb which is called the flower; the plant containing most of this is the best. the remaining tests of its goodness are that it should be black - white varieties are thought inferior - that it is better the shorter and thicker it is and if it is pliant in breaking. the price of the reed is one denarius and that of the rush 5 denarii a pound. it is reported that scented rush is also found in campania.
