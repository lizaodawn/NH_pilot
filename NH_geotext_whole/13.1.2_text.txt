perfumes have received their names in some cases from their countries of origin, in others from the juices of which they are made, in others from trees, and in others front other causes; and the first thing proper to know about them is that their importance changes, quite often their fame having passed away. the perfume most highly praised in the old days was made on the island of delos, but later that from the egyptian town of mendes ranked the highest. nor was this only the result of the blending and combination of several scents, but the same juices gained supremacy or degenerated in various ways in different places. the sword-lily perfume of corinth was extremely popular for a long time, but afterwards that of cyzicus, and similarly the attar of roses made at phaselis, but this distinction was later taken from it by naples, capua and praeneste. oil of saffron from soli in cilicia was for a long time praised most highly, but subsequently that of rhodes; vine-flower scent made in cyprus was preferred, but afterwards that from adramytteum, and scent of marjoram made in cos, but afterwards quince-blossom unguent from the same place, and cyprus-scent made in cyprus, but subsequently that made in egypt; at this point scent from mendes and almond-oil suddenly became more popular, but later on phoenicia appropriated these two scents and left the credit for cyprus-scent to egypt. athens has persistently maintained the credit of her 'all-athenian' perfume. there was also once an unguent called panther-scent at tarsus, even the recipe for compounding which has disappeared; narcissus-scent has also ceased to be made from the narcissus flower.
