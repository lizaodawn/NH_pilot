when the larch and still more the white fir has been felled, a liquid flows from them for a long time. these are the tallest and the straightest of all the trees. for the masts and spars of ships the fir is preferred because of its light weight. a property shared by these trees and also by the pine is that of having veins running through the wood in four or in two divisions, or else only in one line. the interior in the four-veined kind is the best timber to cut up for inlaid wood-work and that in the two-veined the worst, and softer than the other kinds; experts can tell them at once from the bark. fir wood from the part of the tree that was near the ground is free from knots. this timber after being floated in a river in the way which we have described is cleared of bulges, and when so treated is called sappinus, while the upper part which is knotted and harder is called club-wood. moreover in the trees themselves the parts towards the north-east are stronger; and in general trees from damp and shady places are inferior and those from sunny places are closer grained and durable; on this account at rome fir from the tuscan coast is preferred to that from the adriatic.
