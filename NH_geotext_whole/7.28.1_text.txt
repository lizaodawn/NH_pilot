what person has possessed the most outstanding courage is a subject of unending enquiry, at all events if the legendary testimony of poetry be accepted. quintus ennius had a particular admiration for titus caecilius teucer and his brother, adding book x6 to his annals on their account. lucius siccius dentatus, tribune of the plebs in the consulship of spurius tarpeius and aulus aternius not long after the expulsion of the kings, scores an exceedingly large number of votes, as having fought in 120 battles, been challenged to and having won eight single combats, and having the distinction of 45 scars in front and none at all on his back. he also captured spoils 34 times, had bestowed upon him 18 spear-shafts, 25 breast-badges, 83 necklets, 160 bracelets, 26 crowns (including 14 civic crowns, eight of gold, three mural crowns, one siege-rescue crown), a bag of money, ten prisoners of war and with them 20 cows; also he followed in the triumphs of nine generals whose victories were chiefly due to his aid, and in addition - and this in my opinion is his finest achievement - procured the conviction in the people's court at the termination of his consulship of one of his leaders titus romilius on the charge of maladministration of his office. the military distinctions of capitolinus would be not inferior, if he had not cancelled them by the conclusion of his career. he had twice captured enemy's spoils before he was seventeen years old; he had been the first of any one to receive a mural crown as a knight, as well as six civic crowns and 37 gifts; he had received 23 wounds on the front of his body; he had rescued publius servilius master of the horse, when himself wounded in the shoulder and thigh; above all he had alone saved the capitol and the fortunes of the state therein from the gauls - if only he had not saved it to make himself king.
