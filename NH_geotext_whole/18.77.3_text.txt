the third line from the north, which we have drawn transversely to the shadow and have called the decuman, will have the sunrise at the equinoxes and the subsolanus wind, called by the greeks apheliotes. this is the proper aspect for farm-houses and vineyards in healthy localities. this wind itself brings gentle rains; still favonius, the wind in the opposite quarter, blowing from the equinoctial sunset, the greek name for which is zephyrus, is gentler and drier. this is the direction in which cato recommended that olive-yards should face; this wind inaugurates the spring, and opens up the land, having a healthy touch of cold, and it will give the right time for pruning vines, tending crops, planting trees. grafting fruit-trees and treating olives; and its breeze will have a nutritive effect. the fourth line from the north, lying nearest the south on the eastern side, will have the sunrise at midwinter and the wind volturnus, the greek name for which is eurus, which itself also is rather dry and warm; this is the proper aspect for beehives and for vineyards in italy, and the provinces of gaul. directly opposite to volturnus will blow corus, from the point of sunset at midsummer, on the sunset side of north, its greek name being argestes; it also is one of the coldest winds, as are all those blowing from the north; it also brings hailstorms, and is quite as much to be avoided as the north wind. if volturnus begins to blow from a clear part of the sky, it will not last till night, whereas subsolanus goes on for the greater part of the night. whatever the wind is, if it is felt to be hot it will last for several days. the earth suddenly drying up foretells a north-east wind, and if it becomes damp from no visible fall of moisture, a south wind.
