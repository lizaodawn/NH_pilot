the plant panaces by its very name promises to be a cure for every disease; it has many varieties, and to the gods have been ascribed the discovery of its properties. one variety in fact has the additional name of asclepion, after which asclepius called his daughter panacia. the juice of this plant when curdled is like that, already described, of fennel-giant, coming from a root with a thick and salty skin. when it has been pulled up it is a pious duty to fill in the hole with various cereals as an atonement to the earth. where the juice is prepared, and how, and the most esteemed kind, i have already described in my account of exotic plants. the kind imported out of macedonia they call bucolicon, because herdsmen collect the sap as it exudes of its own accord; this evaporates very rapidly. as to the other kinds, the least popular is the dark and soft, for these qualities are signs of adulteration with wax.
