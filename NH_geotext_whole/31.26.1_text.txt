it would be pertinent to add the method of searching for water. it is found mostly in enclosed valleys, and what may be called the hinge of converging slopes, or at the foot of mountains. many have thought that everywhere the northern are the watery slopes. on this matter it would be well to point out the variableness of nature. in the hyrcanian mountains it does not rain on the southern slope, and so only on the north side are there woods. but olympus, ossa, parnassus, the apennines, and the alps, are everywhere covered with trees and watered by rivers; others are so only on the south side, as are the white mountains in crete. so in this matter there will be no unvarying rule to follow.
