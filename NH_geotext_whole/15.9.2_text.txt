the largest fruit and the one that hangs highest is that of pine-cones, which encloses inside it small kernels lying in fretted beds and clothed in another coat of rusty colour, showing the marvellous care that nature takes to provide seeds with a soft place to lie in. a second class of pine-cones is that of the taranto pine, which has a shell that can be broken in the fingers and which is rifled by the birds while on the tree. a third kind is that of the sappinia-cone which grows on the cultivated pitch-pine, the kernels of which have such a soft husk, or rather skin, that it is eaten with them. a fourth kind is called pityis, growing on wild pines, which provides an exceptionally good remedy against a cough when the kernels are boiled in honey; the taurini call them raviceli. the winners in the games at the isthmus are crowned with a wreath of pine leaves.
