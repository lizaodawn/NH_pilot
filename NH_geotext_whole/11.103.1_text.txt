the knees of a human being also possess a sort of religious sanctity in the usage of the nations. suppliants touch the knees and stretch out their hands towards them and pray at them as at altars, perhaps because they contain a certain vital principle. for in the actual joint of each knee, right and left, on the front side there is a sort of twin hollow cavity, the piercing of which, as of the throat, causes the breath to flow away. there is a religious sanctity belonging to other parts also, for instance in the right hand: kisses are imprinted on the back of it, and it is stretched out in giving a pledge. it was a custom with the greeks in early days to touch the chin in entreaty. the memory is seated in the lobe of the ear, the place that we touch in calling a person to witness; similarly behind the right ear is the seat of nemesis (a goddess that even on the capitol has not found a latin name), and to it we apply the third finger after touching our mouths, the mouth being the place where we locate pardon from the gods for our utterances.
