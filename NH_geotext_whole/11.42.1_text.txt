some creatures are generated also by the opposite natural element. thus in the copper foundries of cyprus even in the middle of the fire there flies a creature with wings and four legs, of the size of a rather large fly; it is called the pyrallis, or by some the pyrotocon. as long as it is in the fire it lives, but when it leaves it on a rather long flight it dies off.
