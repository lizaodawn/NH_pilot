the sphagnos valued most highly is found in the province of cyrenaica, south of these regions: others call it bryon. the second place is held by the cyprian kind, and the third by the phoenician. it is also said to grow in egypt, and indeed in gaul as well, and i am not prepared to doubt this; for there are grey tufts that bear this name growing on trees, resembling the growths that we principally see on the oak, but having a superior scent. the most highly esteemed are the whitest and most widely spreading mosses, and the bright red ones are in the second class, but no value at all is attached to the black variety; moreover, the mosses that grow on islands and on rocks are not esteemed, nor are all those that have the scent of palm-trees and not that of their own kind.
