oyster ponds were first invented by sergius orata on the gulf of baiae, in the time of the orator lucius crassus, before the marsian war his motive was not greed but avarice, and he made a great profit out of his practical ingenuity, as he was the first inventor of shower-baths - he used to fit out country houses in this way and then sell them. he was the first to adjudge the best flavour to lucrine oysters - because the same kinds of fish are of better quality in different places, for example wolf-fish in the tiber between the two bridges, turbot at ravenna, lamprey in sicily, sturgeon at rhodes, and other kinds likewise - not to carry out this census of the larder to its conclusion. the coasts of britain were not yet in service when orata used to advertise the fame of the products of the lucrine lake; but subsequently it was deemed worth while to send to the end of italy, to brindisi, for oysters, and to prevent a quarrel between the two delicacies the plan has lately been devised of feeding away in the lake lucrinus the hunger caused by the long porterage from brindisi.
