countries on the other side of africa: if we pass through the interior of africa in a southerly direction, beyond the gaetuli, after having traversed the intervening deserts, we shall find, first of all the liby-egyptians, and then the country where the leucaethiopians dwell. beyond these are the nigritae, nations of aethiopia, so called from the river nigris, which has been previously mentioned, the gymnetes, surnamed pharusii, and, on the very margin of the ocean, the perorsi, whom we have already spoken of as lying on the boundaries of mauritania. after passing all these peoples, there are vast deserts towards the east until we come to the garamantes, the augylae, and the troglodytae; the opinion of those being exceedingly well founded who place two aethiopias beyond the deserts of africa, and more particularly that expressed by homer, who tells us that the aethiopians are divided into two nations, those of the east and those of the west. the river nigris has the same characteristics as the nile; it produces the calamus, the papyrus, and just the same animals, and it rises at the same seasons of the year. its source is between the tarraelian aethiopians and the oecalicae. magium, the city of the latter people, has been placed by some writers amid the deserts, and, next to them the atlantes; then the aegipani, half men, half beasts, the blemmyae, the gamphasantes, the satyri, and the himantopodes.
