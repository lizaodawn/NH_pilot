there is a species of titmouse that makes its nest of dry moss finished off in such a perfect ball that its entrance cannot be found. the bird called the thistle-finch weaves its nest out of flax in the same shape. one of the woodpeckers hangs by a twig at the very end of the boughs, like a ladle on a peg, so that no four-footed animal can get to it. it is indeed asserted that the witwal purposely takes its sleep while hanging suspended by the feet, because it hopes thus to be safer. again, it is a common practice of them all carefully to choose a flooring of branches to support their nest, and to vault it over against the rain or roof it with a penthouse of thick foliage. in arabiad a bird called cinnamolgus makes a nest of cinnamon twigs; the natives bring these birds down with arrows weighted with lead, to use them for trade. in scythia a bird of the size of a bustard lays two eggs at a time in a hare-skin, which is always hung on the top boughs of trees. when magpies notice a person observing their nest with special attention, they transfer the eggs somewhere else. it is reported that in the case of these birds, as their claws are not adapted for grasping and carrying the eggs, this is effected in a remarkable manner: they place a sprig on the top of two eggs at a time, and solder it with glue from their belly, and placing their neck under the middle of it so as to make it balance equally on both sides, carry it off somewhere else.
