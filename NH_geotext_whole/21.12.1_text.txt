there is also a bright-red lily, having sometimes a double stem, and differing from other lilies only in having a fleshier root and a larger bulb, and that undivided. it is called the narcissus. another variety of it has a white flower and a reddish bud. there is this further difference between the ordinary lily and the narcissus, that the leaves of the latter grow straight out of the root. the most popular sort is found on the mountains of lycia. a third kind has all its characteristics the same as those of the other kinds, except that the cup is light green. all the narcissi blossom late, for the flower comes after the rising of arcturus and during the autumnal equinox.
