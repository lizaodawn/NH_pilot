the pinaster is nothing else but a wild pine tree of smaller height throwing out branches from the middle as the pine does at the top. this variety gives a larger quantity of resin, in the manner which we shall describe. it grows in flat countries also. most people think that trees called tibuli that grow along the coasts of italy are the same tree with another name, but the tibulus is a slender tree and more compact than the pinaster, and being free from knots is used for building light gallies; it is almost devoid of resin.
