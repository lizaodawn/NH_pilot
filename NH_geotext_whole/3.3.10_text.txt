the country which extends from the baetis to the river anas, beyond the districts already described, is called baeturia, and is divided into two parts and the same number of nations; the celtici, who border upon lusitania, in the jurisdiction of hispalis, and the turduli, who dwell on the verge of lusitania and tarraconensis, and are under the protection of the laws of corduba. it is evident that the celtici have sprung from the celtiberi, and have come from lusitania, from their religious rites, their language, and the names of their towns, which in baetica are distinguished by the following epithets, which have been given to them. seria has received the surname of fama julia, nertobriga that of concordia julia, segida that of restituta julia, and ugultunia contributa julia, which curiga also has now. constantia julia was lacimurga, the present fortunales were the stereses, and the aeneanici were the callenses. besides these, there are in celtica the towns of acinippo, arunda, arunci, turobriga, lastigi, salpesa, saepone, and serippo.
