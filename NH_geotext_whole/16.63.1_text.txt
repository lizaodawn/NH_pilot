resembling ivy is the plant called smilax, which first came from cilicia, but is now more common in greece; it has thick jointed stalks and thorny branches that make it a kind of shrub; the leaf resembles that of the ivy, but is small and has no corners, and throws out tendrils from its stalk; the flower is white and has the scent of a lily. it bears clusters of berries like those of the wild vine, not of the ivy; they are red in colour, and the larger ones enclose three hard black stones but the smaller a single stone. this plant is unlucky to use at all sacred rites and for wreaths, because it has a mournful association, a maiden named smilax having been turned into a smilax shrub because of her love for a youth named crocus. the common people not knowing this usually pollute their festivals with it because they think that it is ivy; just as in the case of the poets or father liber or silenus, who wear wreaths made of who in the world knows what?
