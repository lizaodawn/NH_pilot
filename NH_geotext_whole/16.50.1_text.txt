and on the island of cos the wild figs bear three, the first eliciting a following crop and the following crop a third one. it is this last crop that is used in the process of caprification. but in the wild fig also the fruit grows at the back of the leaves. among the apples and the pears there are some that bear two crops a year, as also there are some early varieties. the wild apple bears twice, its second crop coming after the rising of arcturus, especially in sunny localities. there are indeed vines that actually bear three crops, which consequently people call 'mad vines,' because on these some grapes are ripening while others are just beginning to swell and other bunches are only in flower. marcus varro states that there once was a vine at the temple of the mother of the gods in smyrna that bore three times a year, and an apple tree in the district of cosenza that did the same. but this regularly occurs in the district of tacupe in africa (about which we shall say more in another place), such is the fertility of the soil. the cypress also bears three times, for its berries are gathered in january, may and september, and those of each crop are of a different size. but also in the trees themselves, even when laden with fruit, there is a difference between different kinds: the arbutus and the oak bear more fruit in their upper part and the walnut and the marisca fig on their lower branches. all trees bear earlier the older they grow, and bear earlier in sunny places and on a thin soil; all wild trees are later, some of them never ripening their fruit at all. similarly trees that have the earth underneath them ploughed or broken up ripen their fruit quicker than ones that are not attended to; those so treated also bear larger crops.
