next to these we will deal with the various kinds of earth which are connected with medicine. there are two sorts of samos earth, called collyrium, 'eye-salve,' and star-earth. the recommendation of the former is that it must be fresh and very soft and sticky to the tongue; the second is more lumpy; both are white in colour. the process is to calcine them and then to wash them. some people prefer the former kind. they are beneficial for people spitting blood, and for plasters made up for drying purposes, and they are also used as an ingredient in medicines for the eyes.
