peridot still preserves its special reputation. it is a greenish variety of its own and, when first discovered, was preferred to any other. once some troglodytes, or cave-dwellers, who were pirates, came ashore, exhausted by hunger and stormy weather, on an arabian island, the name of which was cytis; and it so happened that, while they were digging up plants and roots, they unearthed a peridot. this, at least, is the account accepted by archelaus. juba states that topazos is the name of an island situated in the red sea at a distance of some 35 miles from the mainland. according to him, the island is fog-bound: consequently sailors often have to search for it, and this is why it has acquired its name; for in the troglodyte language topazin means 'to seek.' juba records that the stone was first brought from here as a gift for queen berenice, the mother of ptolemy the second, by his governor [285-246 b.c.] philo; and that, because the king greatly admired it, a statue 4 cubits high was later made of peridot in honour of this ptolemy's wife, arsinoe, and consecrated in the shrine which was named after her the arsinoeum. our most recent authorities assert that the stone is found also near alabastrum, a town in the thebaid, and divide it into two varieties, the 'prasoides,' or 'leek-like,' and the 'chrysopteros,' or 'golden-feathered,' of which the latter resembles the 'chrysoprasus.' in general, the colour tends to resemble the tints of the leek. incidentally, the peridot is the largest of gemstones. also, it is the only precious stone that is affected by an iron file, whereas all others have to be smoothed with naxian stone and emery. moreover, peridot is worn away by use.
