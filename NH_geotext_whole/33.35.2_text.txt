the same mines also produce the mineral called scum of silver. of this there are three kinds, with greek names meaning respectively golden, silvery and leaden; and for the most part all these colours are found in the same ingots. the attic kind is the most approved, next the spanish. the golden scum is obtained from the actual vein, the silvery from silver, and the leaden from smelting the actual lead, which is done at pozzuoli, from which place it takes its name. each kind however is made by heating its raw material till it melts, when it flows down from an upper vessel into a lower one and is lifted out of that with small iron spits and then twisted round on a spit in the actual flame, in order to make it of moderate weight. really, as may be inferred from its name, it is the scum of a substance in a state of fusion and in process of production. it differs from dross in the way in which the scum of a liquid may differ from the lees, one being a blemish excreted by the material when purifying itself and the other a blemish in the metal when purified. some people make two classes of scum of silver which they call 'scirerytis' and 'peumene,' and a third, leaden scum which we shall speak of under the head of lead.
