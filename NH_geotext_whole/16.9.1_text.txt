all the acorn-bearing trees produce oak-apples. oak galls as well, and acorns in alternate years, but the hemeris bears the best oak-apple and the one most suitable for dressing hides. the oak-apple of the broad-leaved oak resembles it, but is lighter in weight and much less highly approved. this tree also produces the black oak-apple - for there are two varieties, this last being more useful for dyeing wool. the oak-apple begins to grow when the sun is leaving the sign of the twins, and always bursts forth full-size in a night. the lighter-coloured variety grows in a single day, and if it encounters a spell of heat it dries up at once and does not attain its proper growth, that is, to have a kernel the size of a bean. the black oak-apple stays fresh and goes on growing for a longer period, so as sometimes to reach the size of an apple. the best kind comes from commagene, and the worst is that produced by the hard-oak; it can be detected by the transparent hollows in it.
