in spain, but particularly in corsica, there is an animal not unlike the sheep, the moufflon, with hair nearer the goat's than the sheep's; these when crossed with sheep produce what in old days were called umbrians. sheep are very weak in the head, and consequently must be made to graze with their backs to the sun. the fleecy sheep is the stupidest of animals; if afraid to go into a place they will follow one of the flock that is taken by the horn. their longest term of life is 10 years, in ethiopia 13; goats in ethiopia live 11 years, but in other parts of the world at most eight. in breeding with either kind to couple three times at most is sufficient.
