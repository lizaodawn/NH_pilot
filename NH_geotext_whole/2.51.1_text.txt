thunderbolts are rare in winter and in summer, from opposite causes. in winter, owing to the thicker envelope of cloud, the air is rendered extremely dense, and all the earth's exhalation being stiff and cold extinguishes whatever fiery vapour it receives. this reason renders scyrthia and the frozen regions round it immune from the fall of thunderbolts, while conversely the excessive heat does the same for egypt, inasmuch as the hot and dry exhalations from the earth condense very rarely, and only form thin and feeble clouds. but in spring and autumn thunderbolts are more frequent, their summer and winter causes being combined in each of those seasons; this explains why they are frequent in italy, where the milder winter and stormy summer make the air more mobile, and it is always somewhat vernal or autumnal. also in the parts of italy that slope down from the north towards the warmth, such as the district of rome and the campagna, lightning occurs in winter just as in summer, which does not happen in any other locality.
