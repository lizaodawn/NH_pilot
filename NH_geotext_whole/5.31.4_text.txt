on returning thence towards the coast, at a distance of twelve miles we find smyrna, originally founded by an amazon [of that name], and rebuilt by alexander; it is refreshed by the river meles, which rises not far off. through this district run what may almost be called the most famous mountains of asia, mastusia in the rear of smyrna, and termetis, joining the foot of olympus. termetis is joined by draco, draco running into tmolus, tmolus into cadmus, and cadmus into taurus. leaving smyrna, the river hermus forms a tract of plains, and gives them its own name. it rises near dorylaion, a city of phrygia, and in its course receives several rivers, among them the one called the phryx, which divides caria from the nation to which it gives name; also the hyllus and the cryos, themselves swollen by the rivers of phrygia, mysia, and lydia. at the mouth of the hermus formerly stood the town of temnos: we now see at the extremity of the gulf the rocks called myrmeces, the town of leuce on a promontory which was once an island, and phocaea, the frontier town of ionia.
