while scipio aemilianus held the command in sicily, polybius the historian received a fleet from him for the purpose of proceeding on a voyage of discovery in this part of the world. he relates, that beyond mount atlas, proceeding in a westerly direction, there are forests filled with wild beasts, peculiar to the soil of africa, as far as the river anatis, a distance of 485 miles, lixos being distant from it 205 miles. agrippa says, that lixos is distant from the straits of gades 112 miles. after it we come to a gulf which is called the gulf of saguti, a town situate on the promontory of mulelacha, the rivers subur and salat, and the port of rutubis, distant from lixos 213 miles. we then come to the promontory of the sun, the port of risardir, the gaetulian autololes, the river cosenus, the nations of the selatiti and the masati, the river masathat, and the river darat, in which crocodiles are found. after this we come to a large gulf, 616 miles in extent, which is enclosed by a promontory of mount barce, which runs out in a westerly direction, and is called surrentium. next comes the river salsus, beyond which lie the aethiopian perorsi, at the back of whom are the pharusii, who are bordered upon by the gaetulian darae, lying in the interior. upon the coast again, we find the aethiopian daratitae, and the river bambotus, teeming with crocodiles and hippopotami. from this river there is a continuous range of mountains till we come to the one which is known by the name of theon ochema, from which to the hesperian promontory is a voyage of ten days and nights; and in the middle of this space he has placed mount atlas, which by all other writers has been stated to be in the extreme parts of mauritania.
