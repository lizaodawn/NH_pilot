the inhabitants of the coasts of this fourth great gulf of europe, as far as istropolis, have been already mentioned in our account of thrace. passing beyond that spot we come to the mouths of the ister. this river rises in germany in the heights of mount abnoba, opposite to rauricum, a town of gaul, and flows for a course of many miles beyond the alps and through nations innumerable, under the name of the danube. adding immensely to the volume of its waters, at the spot where it first enters illyricum, it assumes the name of ister, and, after receiving sixty rivers, nearly one half of which are navigable, rolls into the euxine by six vast channels. the first of these is the mouth of peuce, close to which is the island of peuce itself, from which the neighbouring channel takes its name; this mouth is swallowed up in a great swamp nineteen miles in length. from the same channel too, above istropolis, a lake takes its rise, sixty-three miles in circuit; its name is halmyris. the second mouth is called naracu-stoma; the third, which is near the island of sarmatica, is called calon-stoma; the fourth is known as pseudo-stomon, with its island called conopon-diabasis; after which come the boreon stoma and the psilon-stoma. these mouths are each of them so considerable, that for a distance of forty miles, it is said, the saltness of the sea is quite overpowered, and the water found to be fresh.
