nowadays the first place is given to the wrasse, which is the only fish that is said to chew the cud and to feed on grasses and not on other fish. it is especially common in the carpathian sea; it never of its own accord passes cape lectum in the troad. some wrasse were imported from there in the principate of tiberius claudius by one of his freedmen, optatus, commander of the fleet, and were distributed and scattered about between the mouth of the tiber and the coast of campania, care being taken for about five years that when caught they should be put back into the sea. subsequently they have been frequently found on the coast of italy, though not caught there before; and thus greed has provided itself with additional dainties by cultivating fish, and has bestowed on the sea a new denizen - so that nobody must be surprised that foreign birds breed at rome. the next place belongs at all events to the liver of the lamprey that strange to say the lake of constance in raetia in the central alps also produces to rival the marine variety.
