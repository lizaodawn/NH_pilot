but a very beautiful feature of the maple is the growth on it called bruscum, and yet much more remarkable the molluscum, both knots, the former veined in a twistier pattern, while the latter is covered with simpler markings, and if it were large enough for tables to be made of it would undoubtedly be preferred to citrus-wood; but as it is, except for writing-tablets and veneering on couches, it is seldom seen in use. bruscum is also used for making tables, though they have a darkish colour. a similar growth is also found on the alder, but it is as far inferior to the others as the alder itself is to the maple. the male maple flowers before the female. it must be added that maples grown in dry places are preferred to those in marshes, as is also the case with ash-trees. north of the alps grows a tree making timber that closely resembles the white ash; its greek name is the cluster-tree, as it bears pods containing kernels, which taste like a hazel nut.
