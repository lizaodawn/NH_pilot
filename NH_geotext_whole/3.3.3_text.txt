in this district, the things that more especially deserve notice, or are more easily explained in the latin tongue, are the following, beginning at the river ana, along the line of the seashore; the town of onoba, surnamed aestuaria; the rivers luxia and urium, flowing through this territory between the ana and the baetis; the marian [hareni] mountains; the river baetis; the coast of corum, with its winding bay; opposite to which is gades, of which we shall have occasion to speak among the islands. next comes the promontory of juno, and the port of baesippo; the towns of baelo and mellaria, at which latter begin the straits of the atlantic; carteia, called by the greeks tartessos; and the mountain of calpe.
