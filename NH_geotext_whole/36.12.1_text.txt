onyx marble was supposed by our old authorities to occur in the mountains of arabia and nowhere else. sudines, however, thought that it occurred in carmania. at first only drinking-vessels were made of it, and then the feet of couches and the frames of chairs. cornelius nepos records that it was considered quite extraordinary when publius lentulus spinther exhibited wine jars of onyx marble big enough to hold 9 chian gallons, but that only five years later he himself saw columns 32 feet long. there were striking changes in the history of the stone even after this, for the four small columns placed by cornelius balbus in his theatre caused a sensation, whereas i have seen thirty quite large ones in the dining-room which the emperor claudius' freedman, the notoriously powerful callistus, built for himself. this stone is sometimes called 'alabastrites,' for it is hollowed out to be used also as unguent jars because it is said to be the best means of keeping unguents fresh. it is suitable too, when burnt, for plasters. it occurs in the neighbourhood of thebes in egypt and of damascus in syria. the latter variety is whiter than the rest, but that of carmania is the most excellent. next comes the indian, and then of course there is that of syria and the province of asia, while the least valuable is the cappadocian, which has no lustre whatsoever. the specimens most warmly recommended are the honey-coloured, marked with spirals, and opaque. a colour resembling that of horn, or else gleaming white, and any suggestion of a glassy look are serious faults in onyx marble.
