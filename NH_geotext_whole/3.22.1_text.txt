the tenth region of italy: we now come to the tenth region of italy, situate on the adriatic sea. in this district are venetia, the river silis, rising in the tarvisanian mountains, the town of altinum, the river liquentia rising in the mountains of opitergium, and a port with the same name, the colony of concordia; the rivers and harbours of romatinum, the greater and less tiliaventum, the anaxum, into which the varamus flows, the alsa, and the natiso with the turrus, which flow past the colony of aquileia at a distance of fifteen miles from the sea. this is the country of the carni, and adjoining to it is that of the iapydes, the river timavus, the fortress of pucinum, famous for its wines, the gulf of tergeste, and the colony of that name, thirty-three miles from aquileia. six miles beyond this place lies the river formio, 189 miles distant from ravenna, the ancient boundary of enlarged italy, and now the frontier of istria. that this region takes its name from the river ister which flows from the danube, also called the ister, into the adriatic opposite the mouth of the padus, and that the sea which lies between them is rendered fresh by their waters running from opposite directions, has been erroneously asserted by many, and among them by nepos even, who dwelt upon the banks of the padus. for it is the fact that no river which runs from the danube discharges itself into the adriatic. they have been misled, i think, by the circumstance that the ship argo came down some river into the adriatic sea, not far from tergeste; but what river that was is now unknown. the most careful writers say that the ship was carried across the alps on men's shoulders, having passed along the ister, then along the savus, and so from nauportus, which place, lying between aemona and the alps, from that circumstance derives its name.
