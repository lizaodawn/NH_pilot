the islands in the atlantic ocean: opposite to celtiberia are a number of islands, by the greeks called cassiterides, in consequence of their abounding in tin: and, facing the promontory of the arrotrebae, are the six islands of the gods, which some persons have called the fortunate islands. at the very commencement of baetica, and twenty-five miles from the mouth of the straits of gades, is the island of gadis, twelve miles long and three broad, as polybius states in his writings. at its nearest part, it is less than 700 feet distant from the mainland, while in the remaining portion it is distant more than seven miles. its circuit is fifteen miles, and it has on it a city which enjoys the rights of roman citizens, and whose people are called the augustani of the city of julia gaditana. on the side which looks towards spain, at about 100 paces distance, is another long island, three miles wide, on which the original city of gades stood. by ephorus and philistides it is called erythia, by timaeus and silenus aphrodisias, and by the natives the isle of juno. timaeus says, that the larger island used to be called cotinusa, from its olives; the romans call it tartessos; the carthaginians gadir, that word in the punic language signifying a hedge. it was called erythia because the tyrians, the original ancestors of the carthaginians, were said to have come from the erythraean, or red sea. in this island geryon is by some thought to have dwelt, whose herds were carried off by hercules. other persons again think, that his island is another one, opposite to lusitania, and that it was there formerly called by that name.
