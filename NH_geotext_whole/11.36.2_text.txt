the horns of an indian ant fixed up in the temple of hercules were one of the sights of erythrae. these ants carry gold out of caves in the earth in the region of the northern indians called the dardae. the creatures are of the colour of cats and the size of egyptian wolves. the gold that they dig up in winter time the indians steal in the hot weather of summer, when the heat makes the ants hide in burrows; but nevertheless they are attracted by their scent and fly out and sting them repeatedly although retreating on very fast camels: such speed and such ferocity do these creatures combine with their love of gold.
