the myrtle has also claimed a part in matters of warfare, and publius postumius tubertus, the first of all men who ever entered the city with an ovation, during his consulship celebrated a triumph [503 b.c.] over the sabines, and because he had won the campaign easily, without bloodshed, he made his entry wearing a wreath made of the myrtle of venus vietrix, and so made that tree a coveted object even for our enemies. subsequently a myrtle wreath was regularly worn by generals celebrating an ovation, with the exception of marcus crassus, who when celebrating his victory won from the runaway slaves and spartacus, made his entry wearing a wreath of laurels. masurius informs us that generals going in triumph in a chariot also used to wear a myrtle wreath. lucius piso records that papirius maso, the first general who held a triumph on the alban mount, in [71 b.c.] celebration of his victory over the corsicans, was in the habit of wearing a wreath of myrtle when watching the games in the circus: he was the maternal grandfather of the second africanus. marcus valerius wore two wreaths, one of laurel and one of myrtle, having made a vow to do so.
