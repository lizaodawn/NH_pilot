we have said which animals feed on poison. some otherwise harmless species after feeding on poisonous things become harmful themselves also. in pamphylia and the mountain regions of cilicia people who eat boars when these have devoured a salamander die, for there is no indication in the smell or taste; also water or wine when a salamander has died in it is fatal, and so is even drinking from a vessel out of which one has drunk; and similarly with the kind of frog called a toad! so full of traps is life! wasps devour a snake greedily, and by so doing make their sting fatal. and so widely does diet vary that according to theophrastus in a district where people live on fish the cattle also eat fish, but only live fish.
