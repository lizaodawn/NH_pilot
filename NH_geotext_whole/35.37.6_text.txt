a little before the period of the divine augustus, arellius also was in high esteem at rome, had he not prostituted his art by a notorious outrage, by always paying court to any woman he happened to fall in love with, and consequently painting goddesses, but in the likeness of his mistresses; and so his pictures included a number of portraits of harlots. another recent painter was famulus, a dignified and severe but also very florid artist; to him belonged a minerva who faced the spectator at whatever angle she was looked at. famulus used to spend only a few hours a day in painting, and also took his work very seriously, as he always wore a toga, even when in the midst of his easels. the golden house was the prison that contained his productions, and this is why other examples of his work are not extant to any considerable extent. after him in esteem were cornelius pinus and attius priscus, who painted the temples of honour and virtue for the emperor vespasian's restoration of them; priscus was nearer in style to the artists of old days.
