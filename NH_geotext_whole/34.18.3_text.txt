owners of the figurines called corinthian are usually so enamoured of them that they carry them about with them; for instance the orator hortensius was never parted from the sphinx which he had got out of verres when on trial; this explains cicero's retort when hortensius in the course of an altercation at the trial in question said he was not good at riddles. 'you ought to be,' said cicero, 'as you keep a figurine in your pocket.' the emperor nero also used to carry about with him an amazon which we shall describe later, and a little before nero, the ex-consul gaius cestius used to go about with a sphinx, which he had with him even on the battlefield. it is also said that the tent of alexander the great was regularly erected with four statues as tent-poles, two of which have now been dedicated to stand in front of the temple of mars the avenger and two in front of the royal palace.
