decapolis. on the side of syria, joining up to judaea, is the region of decapolis, so called from the number of its cities; as to which all writers are not agreed. most of them, however, agree in speaking of damascus as one, a place fertilized by the river chrysorroos, which is drawn off into its meadows and eagerly imbibed; philadelphia, and rhaphana, all which cities fall back towards arabia; scythopolis (formerly called nysa by father liber, from his nurse having been buried there), its present name being derived from a scythian colony which was established there; gadara, before which the river hieromix flows; hippo, which has been previously mentioned; dion, pella, rich with its waters; galasa, and canatha. the tetrarchies lie between and around these cities, equal, each of them, to a kingdom, and occupying the same rank as so many kingdoms. their names are, trachonitis, panias, in which is caesarea, with the spring previously mentioned, abila, arca, ampeloessa, and gabe.
