there is an affinity between lime and gypsum, a substance of which there are several varieties. for it can be produced from a heated mineral, as in syria and thurii; it can be dug from the earth, as in cyprus and perrhaebia. there is also that of tymphaea, which is stripped from the earth's surface. the mineral that is heated ought to be like onyx marble or crystalline limestone. in syria the hardest stones possible are selected for the purpose and are heated along with cow dung so that the burning may be accelerated. however, it has been discovered that the best kind is prepared from specular stone a or from stone that flakes in the same way. gypsum, when moistened, should be used instantly, since it coheres with great rapidity. however, there is nothing to prevent it from being pounded and reduced again to a fine powder. gypsum is a serviceable whitewash and is used with pleasing effect for making moulded figures and festoons in architecture. a famous story carries with it something of a warning: we are told that caius proculeius, a man who could rest assured of his close friendship with the emperor augustus, committed suicide by swallowing gypsum when he was suffering from severe pains in the stomach.
