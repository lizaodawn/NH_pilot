susiane is separated from elymais by the river eulaeus, which rises in media, and, after concealing itself in the earth for a short distance, rises again and flows through mesabatene. it then flows round the citadel of susa and the temple of diana, which is held in the highest veneration by all these nations; the river itself being the object of many pompous ceremonials; the kings, indeed, will drink of no other water, and for that reason carry it with them on their journies to any considerable distance. this river receives the waters of the hedypnos, which passes asylus, in persis, and those of the aduna, which rises in susiane. magoa is a town situate near it, and distant from charax fifteen miles; some writers place this town at the very extremity of susiane, and close to the deserts.
