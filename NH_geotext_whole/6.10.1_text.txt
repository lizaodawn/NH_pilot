the rivers cyrus and araxes: the river cyrus takes its rise in the mountains of the heniochi, by some writers called the coraxici; the araxes rises in the same mountains as the river euphrates, at a distance from it of six miles only; and after being increased by the waters of the usis, falls itself, as many authors have supposed, into the cyrus, by which it is carried into the caspian sea.
