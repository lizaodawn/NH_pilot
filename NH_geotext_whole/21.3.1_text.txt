for at first it was customary to make from branches of trees the chaplets used at sacred contests as prizes. later on the custom arose of varying the colour by mixing flowers of different hues, in order to heighten the effect of perfumes and colours in turn. it began at sikyon through the skill of pausias the painter and of the garland-maker glycera, a lady with whom he was very much in love; when he copied her works in his paintings, she to egg him on varied her designs, and there was a duel between art and nature. pictures of this kind painted by that famous artist are still extant, in particular the one called stephaneplocos, in which he painted the lady herself. this took place later than the hundredth olympiad [380 bce]. floral chaplets being now fashionable, it was not long before there appeared what are called egyptian chaplets, and then winter ones, made from dyed flakes of horn at the season when earth refuses flowers. at rome too gradually there crept in the name corollae, given at the first to chaplets because of their delicacy, and presently that of corollaria, after the chaplets presented as prizes began to be made of thin plates, bronze, gilt or silvered.
