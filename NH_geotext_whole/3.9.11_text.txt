romulus left the city of rome, if we are to believe those who state the very greatest number, having three gates and no more. when the vespasians were emperors and censors, in the year from its building 826 [73 ce], the circumference of the walls which surrounded it was thirteen miles and two-fifths. surrounding as it does the seven hills, the city is divided into fourteen districts, with 265 cross-roads under the guardianship of the lares. if a straight line is drawn from the mile-column placed at the entrance of the forum, to each of the gates, which are at present thirty-seven in number (taking care to count only once the twelve double gates, and to omit the seven old ones, which no longer exist), the result will be [taking them altogether], a straight line of twenty miles and 765 paces. but if we draw a straight line from the same mile-column to the very last of the houses, including therein the praetorian encampment , and follow throughout the line of all the streets, the result will then be something more than seventy miles. add to these calculations the height of the houses, and then a person may form a fair idea of this city, and will certainly be obliged to admit that there is not a place throughout the whole world that for size can be compared to it. on the eastern side it is bounded by the agger of tarquinius superbus, a work of surpassing grandeur; for he raised it so high as to be on a level with the walls on the side on which the city lay most exposed to attack from the neighbouring plains. on all the other sides it has been fortified either with lofty walls or steep and precipitous hills, but so it is, that its buildings, increasing and extending beyond all bounds, have now united many other cities to it.
