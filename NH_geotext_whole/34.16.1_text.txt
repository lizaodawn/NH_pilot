that the art of statuary was familiar to italian italy also and of long standing there is indicated by the statue of hercules in the forum boarium said to have been dedicated by evander, which is called 'hercules triumphant,' and on the occasion of triumphal processions is arrayed in triumphal vestments; and also by the two-faced janus, dedicated by king numa, which is worshipped as indicating war and peace, the fingers of the statue being so arranged as to indicate the 355 days of the year, and to betoken that janus is the god of the duration of time. also there is no doubt that the so-called tuscanic images scattered all over the world were regularly made in etruria. i should have supposed these to have been statues of deities only, were it not that metrodorus of scepsis, who received his surname from his hatred of the very name of rome, reproached us with having taken by storm the city of volsinii for the sake of the 2000 statues which it contained. and it seems to me surprising that although the initiation of statuary in italy dates so far back, the images of the gods dedicated in the shrines should have been more usually of wood or terracotta right down to the conquest of asia which introduced luxury here. what was the first origin of representing likenesses in the round will be more suitably discussed when we are dealing with the art for which the greek term is plastic, as that was earlier than the art of bronze statuary. but the latter has flourished to an extent passing all limit and offers a subject that would occupy many volumes if one wanted to give a rather extensive account of it - for as for a completely exhaustive account, who could achieve that?
