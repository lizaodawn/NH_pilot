latium has preserved its original limits, from the tiber to circeii, a distance of fifty miles: so slender at the beginning were the roots from which this our empire sprang. its inhabitants have been often changed, and different nations have peopled it at different times, the aborigines, the pelasgi, the arcades, the seculi, the aurunci, the rutuli, and, beyond circeii, the volsci, the osci, and the ausones whence the name of latium came to be extended as far as the river liris.
