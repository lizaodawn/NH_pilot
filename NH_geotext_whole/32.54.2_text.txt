moreover, there are some fish named by no author. there is one barracuda called 'sudis' in latin, 'sphyraena' in greek, in its muzzle resembling its name ('stake'); it is in size amongst the largest; it is uncommon, and does not degenerate by interbreeding. there are also shells (pinnas) of a kind for which the name 'perna' is given; they are abundant round the pontiac islands.. they stand like pigs' hams fixed bolt upright in the sand; and, gaping not less than a foot wide where there is broad enough space, they lie in wait for food. they have, all round the edges of the shells, teeth set thick like those of a comb; inside is a large fleshy muscle. i once saw also a 'hyena'-fish (puntarzo) which was taken in the island aenaria.
