the clustered arnomum is much in use; it is obtained from the indian wild-vine, or as other people have supposed from a twisted shrub a hand high, and it is plucked with its root and then gently pressed together into bundles, as it is liable to break at once. the kind most highly spoken of is the one with leaves like those of the pomegranate and devoid of wrinkles, coloured red. the second best kind is of a pale colour; the grass-coloured one is not so good, and the white kind is the worst; it also goes white with age. the price of clustered amomum is 60 denarii a pound, but as dust it fetches only 48 denarii. it grows in the part of armenia called otene, and also in media and in pontus. it is adulterated with the leaves of the pomegranate and with liquid gum to make the leaves stick together and form a cluster like a bunch of grapes.
