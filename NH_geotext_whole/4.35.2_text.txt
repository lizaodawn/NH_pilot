mistakes have also been made as to the more celebrated rivers. from the minius, which we have previously mentioned, according to varro, the river aeminius is distant 200 miles, which others suppose to be situate elsewhere, and called limaea. by the ancients it was called the "river of lethe," and it has been made the subject of many fabulous stories. at a distance of 200 miles from the durius is the tagus, the munda lying between them. the tagus is famous for its golden sands. at a distance of 160 miles from it is the sacred promontory, projecting from nearly the very middle of the front of spain. from this spot to the middle of the pyrenees, varro says, is a distance of 1400 miles; while to the anas, by which we have mentioned lusitania as being separated from baetica, is 126 miles, it being 102 more to gades.
