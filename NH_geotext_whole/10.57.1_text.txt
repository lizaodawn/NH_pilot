farmyard hens actually have a religious ritual: after laying an egg they begin to shiver and shake, and purify themselves by circling round, and make use of a straw as a ceremonial rod to cleanse themselves and the eggs. the smallest of birds, the goldfinches, perform their leader's orders, not only with their song but by using their feet and beak instead of hands. one bird in the arelate district, called the bull-bird although really it is small in size, imitates the bellowing of oxen. also the bird whose greek name is 'flower,' when driven away from feeding on grass by the arrival of horses, imitates their neighing, in this way taking its revenge.
