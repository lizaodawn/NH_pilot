the seres: after we have passed the caspian sea and the scythian ocean, our course takes an easterly direction, such being the turn here taken by the line of the coast. the first portion of these shores, after we pass the scythian promontory, is totally uninhabitable, owing to the snow, and the regions adjoining are uncultivated, in consequence of the savage state of the nations which dwell there. here are the abodes of the scythian anthropophagi, who feed on human flesh. hence it is that all around them consists of vast deserts, inhabited by multitudes of wild beasts, which are continually lying in wait, ready to fall upon human beings just as savage as themselves. after leaving these, we again come to a nation of the scythians, and then again to desert tracts tenanted by wild beasts, until we reach a chain of mountains which runs up to the sea, and bears the name of tabis. it is not, however, before we have traversed very nearly one half of the coast that looks towards the north-east, that we find it occupied by inhabitants.
