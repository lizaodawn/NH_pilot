the rivers which run through albania in their course to the sea are the casius and the albanus, and then the cambyses, which rises in the caucasian mountains, and next to it the cyrus, rising in those of the coraxici, as already mentioned. agrippa states that the whole of this coast, inaccessible from rocks of an immense height, is four hundred and twenty-five miles in length, beginning from the river casius. after we pass the mouth of the cyrus, it begins to be called the 'caspian sea;' the caspii being a people who dwell upon its shores.
