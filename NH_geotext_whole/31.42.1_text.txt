salt-pools have reached their highest degree of purity in what may be called embers of salt, which is the lightest and whitest of its kind. 'flower of salt' is also a name given to an entirely different thing, with a moister nature and a saffron or red colour, a kind of salt rust; it has an unpleasant smell, like that of garum, and is different from salt, not only from foam salt. egypt discovered it, and it appears to be brought down by the nile. it also however floats on the surface of certain springs. the best kind of it yields a sort of oily fat, for there is, surprising as it may seem, a fat even in salt. it is adulterated too and coloured by red ochre, or usually by ground crockery; this sham is detected by water, which washes out the artificial colour, while the genuine is only removed by oil, and perfumers use it very commonly because of its colour. in vessels the whiteness is seen on the surface, but the inner part, as i have said, is moister. the nature of flower of salt is acrid, heating, bad for the stomach, sudorific, aperient when taken in wine and water, and useful for anodynes and detergents. it also removes hair from eyelids. the sediment is shaken up in order to restore the saffron colour. besides these salines there is also what is called at the salt-pools salpugo, or sometimes salsilago. it is entirely liquid, differing from sea brine by its more salty character.
