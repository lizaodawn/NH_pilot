nothing is more prolific than wheat - nature having given it this attribute because it used to be her principal means of nourishing man - inasmuch as a peck of wheat, given suitable soil like that of the byzacian plain in africa, produces a yield of 150 pecks. the deputy governor of that region sent to his late majesty augustus - almost incredible as it seems - a parcel of very nearly 400 shoots obtained from a single grain as seed, and there are still in existence despatches relating to the matter. he likewise sent to nero also 360 stalks obtained from one grain. at all events the plains of leontini and other districts in sicily, and the whole of baetica, and particularly egypt reproduce at the rate of a hundredfold. the most prolific kinds of wheat are branched wheat and what they call hundred-grain wheat. also a single beanstalk has before now been found laden with a hundred beans.
