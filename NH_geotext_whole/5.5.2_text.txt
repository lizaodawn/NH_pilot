after the nasamones we come to the dwellings of the asbystae and the macae, and beyond them, at eleven days' journey to the west of the greater syrtis, the amantes, a people also surrounded by sands in every direction. they find water however without any difficulty at a depth mostly of about two cubits, as their district receives the overflow of the waters of mauritania. they build houses with blocks of salt, which they cut out of their mountains just as we do stone. from this nation to the troglodytae the distance is seven days' journey in a south-westerly direction, a people with whom our only intercourse is for the purpose of procuring from them the precious stone which we call the carbuncle, and which is brought from the interior of aethiopia. upon the road to this last people, but turning off towards the deserts of africa, of which we have previously made mention as lying beyond the lesser syrtis, is the region of phazania; the nation of phazanii, belonging to which, as well as the cities of alele and cilliba, we have subdued by force of arms, as also cydamus, which lies over against sabrata. after passing these places a range of mountains extends in a prolonged chain from east to west: these have received from our people the name of the black mountains, either from the appearance which they naturally bear of having been exposed to the action of fire, or else from the fact that they have been scorched by the reflection of the sun's rays. beyond it is the desert, and then talgae, a city of the garamantes, and debris, at which place there is a spring, the waters of which, from noon to midnight, are at boiling heat, and then freeze for as many hours until the following noon; garama too, that most famous capital of the garamantes; all which places have been subdued by the roman arms. it was on this occasion that cornelius balbus was honoured with a triumph, the only foreigner indeed that was ever honoured with the triumphal chariot, and presented with the rights of a roman citizen; for, although by birth a native of gades, the roman citizenship was granted to him as well as to the elder balbus, his uncle by the father's side. there is also this remarkable circumstance, that our writers have handed down to us the names of the cities above-mentioned as having been taken by balbus, and have informed us that on the occasion of his triumph, besides cydamus and garama, there were carried in the procession the names and models of all the other nations and cities, in the following order: the town of tabudium, the nation of niteris, the town of nigligemella, the nation or town of bubeium, the nation of enipi, the town of thuben, the mountain known as the black mountain, nitibrum, the towns called rapsa, the nation of discera, the town of debris, the river nathabur, the town of thapsagum, the nation of nannagi, the town of boin, the town of pege, the river dasibari; and then the towns, in the following order, of baracum, buluba, alasit, galia, balla, maxalla, zizama, and mount gyri, which was preceded by an inscription stating that this was the place where precious stones were produced.
