but every end leads to fresh starts, and men make a sport of spending, and like doubling their sports by combining them and re-adulterating nature's adulterations, for instance staining tortoiseshells, alloying gold with silver to produce amber-metal ware, and adding copper to these to make corinthian ware. it is not enough to have stolen for a dye the name of a gem, 'sober-stone,' but when finished it is made drunk again with tyrian dye, so as to produce from the combination an outlandish name and a twofold luxury at one time; and when they have made shell-dye, they think it an improvement for it to pass into tyrian. repentance must have discovered this first, the artificer altering a product that he disapproved of; but reason sprang up next, and a defect was turned into a success by marvellous inventions, and a double path pointed out for luxury, so that one colour might be concealed by another, being pronounced to be made sweeter and softer by this process; and also a method to blend minerals, and dye with tyrian a fabric already dyed with scarlet, to produce colour. the kermes, a red kernel of galatia, as we shall say when dealing with the products of the earth, or else in the neighbourhood of augusta emerita in lusitania, is most approved. but, to finish off these famous dyes at once, the kernel when a year old has a viscous juice, and also after it is four years old the juice tends to disappear, so that it lacks strength both when fresh and when getting old. we have amply dealt with the method whereby the beauty of men and women alike believes that it is rendered most abundant.
