in early times the lintels and folding doors of temples as well were commonly made of bronze. i find that also gnaeus octavius, who was granted a triumph after a sea-fight against king perseus, constructed the double colonnade at the flaminian circus which owing to the bronze capitals of its columns has received the name of the corinthian portico, and that a resolution was passed that even the temple of vesta should have its roof covered with an outer coating of syracusan metal. the capitals of the pillars in the pantheon which were put up by marcus [21 b.c.] agrippa are of syracusan metal. moreover even private opulence has been employed in similar uses: one of the charges brought against camillus [391 b.c.] by the quaestor spurius carvilius was that in his house he had doors covered with bronze.
