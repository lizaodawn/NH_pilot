the bean is sown first of the leguminous plants, before the setting of the pleiades, so that it may get ahead of winter. virgil advises sowing it all through the spring, as is the custom of italy near the river po, but the majority of people prefer bean crops of early sowing to the produce of three months' growth, for the pods and stalks of beans sown early make the most acceptable fodder for cattle. when the bean is in flower it particularly wants water, but when it has shed its blossom it only needs little. it serves instead of stable manure to fertilize the ground it is grown in; consequently in the districts of macedon and thessaly when it begins to blossom the farmers plough up the fields. it also grows wild in most places, for example the islands of the north sea, for which our name is consequently the bean islands, and it also grows wild all over mauretania, though this bean is very hard and incapable of being cooked. it also grows in egypt, where it has a thorny stalk which makes the crocodiles keep away from it for fear of injuring their eyes. the stalk is two yards long at most and the thickness of a finger: if it had knots in it, it would be like a soft reed; it has a head like a poppy, is rose-coloured, and bears not more than thirty beans on each stalk; the leaves are large; the actual fruit is bitter even in smell, but the root is a very popular article of diet with the natives, and is eaten raw and cooked in every sort of way; it resembles the roots of reeds. the egyptian bean also grows in syria and cilicia, and at the lake of torone in chalcidice.
