it is noted in the annals that it was in the censorship of lucius paullus and quintus marcius [164 bce] that there appeared for the first time in italy the carbuncle, a disease peculiar to the province of gallia narbonensis. there died of it in the same year as i compose my work two men of consular rank, julius rufus and laecanius bassus, the former through the ignorance of his physicians, who tried lancing; the latter, however, through his own tearing out with a needle from his left thumb a splinter (boil) so small that it could scarcely be seen. the carbuncle forms in the most hidden parts of the body, and usually as a red hardness under the tongue, like a pimple but blackish at the top, occasionally of a leaden colour, spreading into the flesh but without swelling, pain, irritation, or any other symptom than sleep, overcome by which the patient is carried off in three days. sometimes also the disease, bringing shivering, small pustules around the sore, and more rarely fever, has reached the oesophagus and pharynx, causing death very quickly.
