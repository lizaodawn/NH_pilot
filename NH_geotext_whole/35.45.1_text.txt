most highly praised modellers were damophilus and gorgasus, who were also painters they had decorated the shrine of ceres in the circus maximus at rome with both kinds of their art, and there is an inscription on the building in greek verse in which they indicated that the decorations on the right hand side were the work of damophilus and those on the left were by gorgasus. varro states that before this shrine was built everything in the temples was tuscanic work; and that when this shrine was undergoing restoration the embossed work of the walls was cut out and enclosed in framed panels; and that the figures also were taken from the pediment and dispersed. chalcosthenes also executed at athens some works in unbaked clay, at the place named the ceramicus, potters quarter, after his workshop. marcus varro records that he knew at rome an artist named possis who made fruit and grapes in such a way that nobody could tell by sight from the real things. varro also speaks very highly of arcesilaus, who was on terms of intimacy with lucius lucullus, and says that his sketch-models of clay used to sell for more, among artists themselves, than the finished works of others; and that this artist made the statue of venus genetrix in caesar's forum and that it was erected before it was finished as there was a great haste to dedicate it; and that the same artist had contracted with lucullus to make a statue of felicitas for 1,000,000 sesterces, which was prevented by the death of both parties; and that when a knight of rome octavius desired him to make a wine-bowl he made him a model in plaster for the price of a talent. he also praises pasiteles, who said that modelling was the mother of chasing and of bronze statuary and sculpture, and who, although he was eminent in all these arts, never made anything before he had made a clay model. he also states that this art had already been brought to perfection by italy and especially by etruria; that vulca was summoned from veii to receive the contract from tarquinius priscus for a statue of jupiter to be consecrated in the capitol, and that this jupiter was made of clay and consequently was regularly painted with cinnabar; and that the four-horse chariots about which we spoke above on the pediment of the temple were modelled in clay; and that the figure of hercules, which even today retains in the city the name of the material it is made of, was the work of the same artist. for these were the most splendid images of gods at that time; and we are not ashamed of those ancestors of ours for worshipping them in that material. for they used not formerly to work up silver and gold even for gods.
