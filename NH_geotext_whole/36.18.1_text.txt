another towering structure built by a king is also extolled, namely the one that stands on pharos, the island that commands the harbour at alexandria. the tower is said to have cost 800 talents. we should not fail to mention the generous spirit shown by king ptolemy, whereby he allowed the name of the architect, sostratus of cnidos, to be inscribed on the very fabric of the building. it serves, in connection with the movements of ships at night, to show a beacon so as to give warning of shoals and indicate the entrance to the harbour. similar beacons now burn brightly in several places, for instance at ostia and ravenna. the danger lies in the uninterrupted burning of the beacon, in case it should be mistaken for a star, the appearance of the fire from a distance being similar. the same architect is said to have been the very first to build a promenade supported on piers: this he did at cnidos.
