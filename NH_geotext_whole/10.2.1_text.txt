they say that ethiopia and the indies possess birds extremely variegated in colour and indescribable, and that arabia has one that is famous before all others (though perhaps it is fabulous), the phoenix, the only one in the whole world and hardly ever seen. the story is that it is as large as an eagle, and has a gleam of gold round its neck and all the rest of it is purple, but the tail blue picked out with rose-coloured feathers and the throat picked out with tufts, and a feathered crest adorning its head. the first and the most detailed roman account of it was given by manilius, the eminent senator famed for his extreme and varied learning acquired without a teacher: he stated that nobody has ever existed that has seen one feeding, that in arabia it is sacred to the sun-god, that it lives 540 years, that when it is growing old it constructs a nest with sprigs of wild cinnamon and frankincense, fills it with scents and lies on it till it dies; that subsequently from its bones and marrow is born first a sort of maggot, and this grows into a chicken, and that this begins by paying due funeral rites to the former bird and carrying the whole nest down to the city of the sun near panchaia and depositing it upon an altar there. manilius also states that the period of the great year coincides with the life of this bird, and that the same indications of the seasons and stars return again, and that this begins about noon on the day on which the sun enters the sign of the ram, and that the year of this period had been 215, as reported by him, in the consulship of publius licinius and gnaeus cornelius. cornelius valerianus reports that a phoenix flew down into egypt in the consulship of quintus plautius and sextus papinius; it was even brought to rome in the censorship of the emperor claudius, a.u.c. 800 and displayed in the comitium, a fact attested by the records, although nobody would doubt that this phoenix was a fabrication.
