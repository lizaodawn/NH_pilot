the first roman to own a collection of gemstones (for which we normally use the foreign term 'dactyliotheca,' or 'ring cabinet') was sulla's stepson scaurus. for many years there was no other until pompey the great dedicated in the capitol among his other offerings a ring cabinet that had belonged to king mithridates. this, as varro and other authorities of the period confirm, was far inferior to that of scaurus. pompey's example was followed by julius caesar, who during his dictatorship consecrated six cabinets of gems in the temple of venus genetrix, and by marcellus, octavia's son, who dedicated one in the temple of apollo on the palatine.
