the seventh region of italy: next to this comes the seventh region, in which is etruria, a district which begins at the river macra, and has often changed its name. at an early period the umbri were expelled from it by the pelasgi; and these again by the lydians, who from a king of theirs were named tyrrheni, but afterwards, from the rites observed in their sacrifices, were called, in the greek language, tusci. the first town in etruria is luna, with a noble harbour, then the colony of luca, at some distance from the sea, and nearer to it again the colony of pisae, between the rivers auser and arnus, which owes its origin to pelops and the pisans, or else to the teutani, a people of greece. next is vada volaterrana, then the river cecinna, and populonium formerly belonging to the etrurians, the only town they had on this coast. next to these is the river prile, then the umbro, which is navigable, and where the district of umbria begins, the port of telamon, cosa of the volcientes, founded by the roman people, graviscae, castrum novum, pyrgi, the river caeretanus, and caere itself, four miles inland, called agylla by the pelasgi who founded it, alsium, fregenae, and the river tiber, 284 miles from the macra.
