after this ring, the most renowned gemstone is that of another king, the famous pyrrhus who [319-272 bc] fought a war against rome. he is said to have possessed an agate on which could be seen the nine muses with apollo holding his lyre. this was due not to any artistic intention, but to nature unaided; and the markings spread in such a way that even the individual muses had their appropriate emblems allotted to them. apart from these stones, my authorities can produce no gems famous enough to be specially recorded. they merely state that ismenias the pipe-player was in the habit of wearing a large number of brilliant stones and that there is a story associated with his vanity. in cyprus a 'smaragdus' with the figure of amymone engraved upon it was offered for sale at a price of six gold pieces. ismenias ordered the sum to be paid and, when two of the pieces were returned to him, he exclaimed, 'heavens! i've been done. the stone has been robbed of much of its value.' it is ismenias who appears to have brought in the fashion whereby all musical accomplishments came to be assessed partly in terms of this kind of lavish display. this was the case with his contemporary and rival dionysodorus. consequently, ismenias seemed to be equalled through this very circumstance by a man who was only third among the musicians of the time. as for nicomachus, he is said to have possessed merely large numbers of stones chosen without any discrimination.
