there are also considerable differences between races. i have heard for instance about tapeworms and maw-worms, that they infest the peoples of egypt, arabia, syria and cilicia, while on the contrary they are never found at all among those of thrace and phrygia. this is less remarkable than their being found among the thebans, but not among the athenians, although attica and boeotia are adjoining territories. that thought brings me to the nature of animals themselves, and to the remedies for all diseases, of even greater reliability, that are implanted in them at birth. for again, the mother of all creation both willed that no animal should be born merely to eat or to satisfy the appetites of others, implanting also healthful medicines in their vitals, because she was implanting them even in unconscious things, and she also willed that those outstanding aids to life should come from another life, a thought beyond all else most wonderful.
