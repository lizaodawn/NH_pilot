lusitania: after passing the durius, lusitania begins. we here have the ancient turduli, the paesuri, the river vaga, the town of talabrica, the town and river of aeminium, the towns of conimbrica, collippo, and eburobritium. a promontory then advances into the sea in shape of a large horn; by some it has been called artabrum, by others the great promontory, while many call it the promontory of olisipo, from the city near it. this spot forms a dividing line in the land, the sea, and the heavens. here ends one side of spain; and, when we have doubled the promontory, the front of spain begins. on one side of it lie the north and the gallic ocean, on the other the west and the atlantic. the length of this promontory has been estimated by some persons at sixty miles, by others at ninety. a considerable number of writers estimate the distance from this spot to the pyrenees at 1250 miles; and, committing a manifest error, place here the nation of the artabri, a nation that never was here. for, making a slight change in the name, they have placed at this spot the arrotrebae, whom we have previously spoken of as dwelling in front of the celtic promontory.
