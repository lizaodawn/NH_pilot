upon the coast again is mantium, and ephesus, which was founded by the amazons, and formerly called by so many names: alopes at the time of the trojan war, after that ortygia and morges, and then smyrna, with the surname of trachia, as also samornion and ptelea. this city is built on mount pion, and is washed by the cayster, a river which rises in the cilbian range and brings down the waters of many streams, as also of lake pegasaeus, which receives those discharged by the river phyrites. from these streams there accumulates a large quantity of slime, which vastly increases the soil, and has added to the mainland the island of syrie, which now lies in the midst of its plains. in this city is the fountain of calippia and the temple of diana, which last is surrounded by two streams, each known by the name of selenus, and flowing from opposite directions.
