the whole globe is divided into three parts, europe, asia, and africa. our description commences where the sun sets and at the straits of gades, where the atlantic ocean, bursting in, is poured forth into the inland seas. as it makes its entrance from that side, africa is on the right hand and europe on the left; asia lies between them; the boundaries being the rivers tanais and nile. the straits of the ocean, of which i have just spoken, extend fifteen miles in length and five in breadth, measured from the village of mellaria in spain to the album promontorium or white promontory in africa, as we learn from turranius gracilis, who was born in that vicinity. titus livius and cornelius nepos however have stated the breadth, where it is least, to be seven miles, and where greatest, ten; from so small a mouth as this does so immense an expanse of water open upon us! nor is our astonishment diminished by the fact of its being of great depth; for, instead of that, there are numerous breakers and shoals, white with foam, to strike the mariner with alarm. from this circumstance it is, that many have called this spot the threshold of the inland sea.
