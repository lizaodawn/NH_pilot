acarnania: the towns of acarnania, the ancient name of which was curetis, are heraclia, echinus, and, on the coast, actium, a colony founded by augustus, with its famous temple of apollo and the free city of nicopolis. passing out of the ambracian gulf into the ionian sea, we come to the coast of leucadia, with the promontory of leucate, and then the gulf and the peninsula of leucadia, which last was formerly called neritis. by the exertions of the inhabitants it was once cut off from the mainland, but was again joined to it by the vast bodies of sand accumulated through the action of the winds. this spot is called dioryctos, and is three stadia in length: on the peninsula is the town of leucas, formerly called neritus. we next come to alyzia, stratos, and argos, surnamed amphilochian, cities of the acarnanians: the river achelous flows from the heights of pindus, and, after separating acarnania from aitolia, is fast adding the island of artemita to the mainland by the continual deposits of earth which it brings down its stream.
