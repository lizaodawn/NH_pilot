the original paved floors, in my belief, were those now known to us as 'foreign' and 'indoor' floors. in italy these were beaten with staves: at any rate, this is what the name itself may imply. at rome the first floor with a diamond pattern was constructed in the temple of jupiter capitolinus after the beginning of the third punic war; but tessellated pavements had already become common and extremely popular before the cimbrian war, as is shown by the famous verse from lucilius: with paviour's skill and wavy inset stones.
