afterwards comes a vast crowd of plums. there is the parti-coloured plum, partly black and partly white in colour, which is called the barley-plum because it ripens at barley harvest; and another plum of the same colour, which is later and is larger in size, called the donkey-plum from its inferior value. the wax-plum and the purple plum are smaller in size but more esteemed; and there is also the armenian plum, imported from foreign parts, the only plum that recommends itself even by its scent. plums grafted on a nut-tree show a remarkable effrontery, displaying the appearance of the parent tree and the juice of the adopted stock; they take their name from each, being called nut-plums. but both the nut-plum and the peach and the wax-plum and the wild plum, if stored in casks like grapes, will prolong their life till another crop begins to come into existence, but the remaining varieties, ripening quickly, speedily pass off. recently in boetica the name of apple-plum has begun to be given to plums grafted on apple-trees, and that of almond-plum to others grafted on almonds: the latter have the kernel of an almond inside their stone; and indeed no other fruit has been more ingeniously crossed. among our foreign trees, we have already spoken of the damson, named from damascus in syria; it has been grown in italy for a long time, though it has a larger stone and less flesh here than in its country of origin, and here it never dries into wrinkles, because it lacks its native sunshine. with it can be mentioned its fellow-countryman the myxa, which also has now begun to be grown at rome by being grafted on the service-tree.
