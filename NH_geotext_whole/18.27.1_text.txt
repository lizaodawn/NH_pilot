as for bread itself it appears superfluous to give an account of its various kinds - in some places bread called after the dishes eaten with it, such as oyster-bread, in others from its special delicacy, as cake-bread, in others from the short time spent in making it, as hasty-bread, and also from the method of baking, as oven bread or tin loaf or baking-pan bread; while not long ago there was even bread imported from parthia, called water bread because by means of water it is drawn out into a thin spongy consistency full of holes; others call it just parthian bread. the highest merit depends on the goodness of the wheat and the fineness of the bolter. some use eggs or milk in kneading the dough, while even butter has been used by races enjoying peace, when attention can be devoted to the varieties of pastry-making. the ancona country still retains the popularity it won in the invention of bread from using spelt as the material; this bread is steeped for nine days and on the tenth day they knead it up with raisin juice into the shape of a long roll and afterwards put it in earthenware pots and bake it in ovens, the pots breaking in the process. it is not used for food unless it has been soaked, for which chiefly milk or honey-water is employed.
