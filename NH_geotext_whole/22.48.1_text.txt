all these fungus growths spring up with showers, and silphium too, as has been mentioned, first grew with a shower. at the present day it is imported chiefly from syria, this syrian silphium being not so good as the parthian, though better than the median; the silphium of cyrene, as i have said, is now wholly extinct. the leaves of silphium are used in medicine to purge the uterus and to bring away the dead unborn baby; a decoction of them is made in white, aromatic wine, to be drunk after the bath in doses of one acetabulum. the root is good for soreness of the windpipe, and is applied to collections of extravasated blood; but it is hard to digest when taken as food, causing flatulence and belchings. it is injurious to the passing of urine, but with wine and oil most beneficial for bruises, and with wax for scrofulous swellings. warts in the seat fall off if fumigated with it several times.
