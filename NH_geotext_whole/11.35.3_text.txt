italy is infested by swarms of them, coming principally from africa, the roman nation having often been compelled by fear of dearth to resort to remedies prescribed by the sibylline books. in the district of cyrene there is actually a law to make war upon them three times a year, the first time by crushing the eggs, then the grubs and last the fully grown insects, with the penalty of a deserter for the man who shirks. also in the island of lemnos there is a rule prescribing a definite quantity of locusts killed that each man has to bring in to the magistrates. also they keep jays for this purpose, which meet them by flying in the opposite direction, to their destruction. in syria as well people are commandeered by military order to kill them. in so many parts of the world is this plague abroad; but with the parthians even the locust is an acceptable article of diet.
