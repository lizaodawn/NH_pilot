in their proper places i have already spoken of the plant called lotus, and also of the egyptian plant called by the same name, sometimes known also as the tree of the syrtes. the berries of this lotus, which by our countrymen is called the greek bean, cheek looseness of the bowels. shavings of the wood, boiled down in wine, are good for dysentery, irregular menstruation, giddiness and epilepsy. they also prevent the hair from falling out. it is strange that nothing is more bitter than these shavings or sweeter than lotus fruit. from the sawdust also of the wood a medicine is prepared by boiling it down in myrtle water; it is then kneaded and cut into lozenges, which make a very useful medicine for dysentery, the dose being one victoriatus to three cyathi of water.
