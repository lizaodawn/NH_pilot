for it is for the sake of their timber that nature has created the rest of the trees, and the most productive of them all, the ash. this is a lofty, shapely tree, itself also having feathery foliage, and has been rendered extremely famous by the advertisement given it by homer as supplying the spear of achilles. the wood of the ash is useful for a great many purposes. the kind grown on ida in the troad so closely resembles cedar-wood that when the bark has been removed it deceives buyers. the greeks have distinguished two kinds of ash-tree, a tall one without knots and the other a short tree with harder and darker wood and foliage like that of the bay-tree. in macedonia there is a very large ash making very flexible timber, which has the greek name of 'ox-ash.' other people have distinguished the ash-tree by locality, as they say that the ash of the plains has a crinkly grain and the mountain ash is close-grained. greek writers have stated that the leaves of the ash are poisonous to beasts of burden, though doing no harm to all the other kinds of ruminants; but in italy they are harmless to beasts of burden also. indeed, they are found to be serviceable as an exceptionally effective antidote for snakebites, if the juice is squeezed out to make a potion and the leaves are applied to the wound as a poultice; and they are so potent that a snake will not come in contact with the shadow of the tree even in the morning or at sunset when it is at its longest, so wide a berth does it give to the tree itself. we can state from actual experiment that if a ring of ash-leaves is put round a fire and a snake, the snake will rather escape into the fire than into the ash-leaves. by a marvellous provision of nature's kindness the ash flowers before the snakes come out and does not shed its leaves before they have gone into hibernation.
