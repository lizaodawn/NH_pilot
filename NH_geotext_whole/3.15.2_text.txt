at the promontory of lacinium begins the second gulf of europe, the bend of which forms an are of great depth, and terminates at acroceraunium, a promontory of epirus, from which it is distant seventy-five miles. we first come to the town of croton, and then the river neaethus, and the town of thurii, situate between the two rivers crathis and sybaris, upon the latter of which there was once a city of the same name. in a similar manner heraclia, sometimes called siris, lies between the river of that name and the aciris. we next come to the rivers acalandrus and casuentum, and the town of metapontum, with which the third region of italy terminates. in the interior of bruttium, the aprustani are the only people; but in lucania we find the atinates, the bantini, the eburini, the grumentini, the potentini, the sontini, the sirini, the tergilani, the ursentini, and the volcentani, whom the numestrani join. besides these, we learn from cato that thebes in lucania has disappeared, and theopompus informs us that there was formerly a city of the lucani called pandosia, at which alexander, the king of epirus, died.
