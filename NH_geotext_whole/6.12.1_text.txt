the passes of the caucasus: after passing the last, we come to the gates of caucasus, by many persons most erroneously called the caspian passes; a vast work of nature, which has suddenly wrenched asunder in this place a chain of mountains. at this spot are gates barred up with beams shod with iron, while beneath the middle there runs a stream which emits a most fetid odour; on this side of it is a rock, defended by a fortress, the name of which is cumania, erected for the purpose of preventing the passage of the innumerable tribes that lie beyond. here, then, we may see the habitable world severed into two parts by a pair of gates; they are just opposite to harmastis, a town of the iberi.
