at assos in the troad we find the sarcophagus stone, which splits along a line of cleavage. it is well known that corpses buried in it are consumed within a period of forty days, except for the teeth: mucianus vouches for the fact that mirrors, scrapers, clothes and shoes placed upon the dead bodies are turned to stone as well. there are similar stones both in lycia and in the east; and these, when attached even to living persons, eat away their bodies.
