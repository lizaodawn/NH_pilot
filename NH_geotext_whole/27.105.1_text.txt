rhecoma is imported from the regions beyond pontus. the root resembles dark costus, but is smaller and a little redder, without smell but with a hot, astringent taste. when pounded it also is of a wine-like colour, but inclining to saffron. used as liniment it reduces gatherings and inflammations, and heals wounds; in raisin wine it relieves eye-fluxes; with honey it removes dark bruises, and in vinegar other livid marks. powdered it is sprinkled over malignant sores; for spitting of blood a drachma by weight is taken in water; for dysentery too and coeliac disease, should no fever be present, it is given in wine, but where there is fever, in water. it is easier to pound if it is steeped the night before. its decoction too is given, to be drunk in double doses, for ruptures, sprains, bruises, and tumbles from a height. should there be pains in the chest, a little quantity of pepper and myrrh is added; should the stomach be relaxed, it is taken in cold water; so also for chronic cough and spitting of pus, likewise for liver complaints, spleen complaints, sciatica, kidney troubles, asthma, and orthopnoea. roughness of the trachea is cured by three-oboli doses of it pounded and taken in raisin wine, or by its decoction. lichen also is cleared away by an application of the root in vinegar. it is taken in drink for flatulence, chills, feverish shivers, hiccough, colic, herpes, heaviness of the head, bilious giddiness, tired pains, and sprains.
