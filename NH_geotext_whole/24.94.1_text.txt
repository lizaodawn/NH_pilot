there is also a plant called the ails, which too is a native of egypt. it is similar to the aron, only itself and its leaves are smaller, as is also the root in particular, though it is as big as a full-sized olive. the white kind puts out twin stems, the other kind one only. either is good for running sores as well as for burns, and for fistula also if a suppository made of it be inserted. corroding ulcers are arrested by an application of their leaves boiled in water and then beaten up with the addition of rose oil. but there is one great marvel connected with this plant: if it touches the sexual organs of any female animal she is driven to destruction.
