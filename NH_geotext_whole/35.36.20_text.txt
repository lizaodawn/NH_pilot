to the list of these artists must also be added nicomachus son and pupil of aristides. he painted a rape of persephone, a picture formerly in the shrine of minerva on the capitol, just above the chapel of youth; and there was also in the capitol, where it was placed by general plancus, his victory hurrying her chariot aloft. he was the first painter who represented odysseus wearing a felt skull-cap. he also painted an apollo and artemis, and the mother of the gods seated on a lion, and likewise a fine picture of bacchants with satyrs prowling towards them, and a scylla that is now in the temple of peace in rome. no other painter was ever a more rapid worker. indeed it is recorded that he accepted a commission from the tyrant of sikyon aristratus to paint by a given date a monument that he was erecting to the poet telestes, and that he only arrived not long before the date; the wrathful tyrant threatened to punish him, but in a few days he finished the work with a speed and an artistic skill that were both remarkable. among his pupils were his brother ariston and his son aristides and philoxenus of eretria, who painted for king cassander a picture that holds the highest rank, containing a battle between alexander and darius. he also painted a picture with a wanton subject showing three sileni at their revels. imitating the rapidity of his master he introduced some shorthand methods of painting, executed with still more rapidity of technique.
