there are some writers who state that there are the following nations dwelling around the maeotis, as far as the ceraunian mountains; at a short distance from the shore, the napitae, and beyond them, the essedones, who join up to the colchians, and dwell upon the summits of the mountains: after these again, the camacae, the orani, the autacae, the mazacasi, the cantiocae, the agamathae, the pici, the rimosoli, the acascomarci, and, upon the ridges of the caucasus, the itacalae, the imadochi, the rami, the anclacae, the tydii, the carastasei, and the anthiandae. the river lagous runs from the cathaean mountains, and into it flows the opharus. upon it are the tribes of the cauthadae, and the opharitae. next to these are the rivers menotharus and imityes, which flow from the cissian mountains, among the peoples called the acdei, the carnae, the oscardei, the accisi, the gabri, the gogari, and, around the source of the imityes, the imityi, and the apatraei. some writers say that the auchetae, the athernei, and the asampatae, scythian tribes, have made inroads upon this territory, and have destroyed the tanaitae and the inapaei to a man. others again represent the ocharius as running through the cantici and the sapaei, and the tanais as passing through the territories of the sarcharcei, the herticei, the spondolici, the synhietae, the anasi, the issi, the catetae, the tagorae, the caroni, the neripi, the agandei, the mandarei, the satarchei, and the spalei.
