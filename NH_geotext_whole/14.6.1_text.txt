the most ancient celebrity belongs to the wine of maronea grown in the seaboard parts of thrace, as we learn from homer. however, we need not pursue the legendary or variously reported stories conceding its origin, except the statement that aristaeus was the first person of all in the same nation who mixed honey with wine, because of the outstandingly agreeable quality of each of these natural products. homer has recorded the mixing of maronean wine with water in the proportion of 20 parts of water to one of wine. this class of wine in the same district still retains its strength and its insuperable vigour, inasmuch as one of the most recent authors, mucianus, who was three times consul, ascertained when actually visiting that region that it is the custom to mix with one pint of this wine eight pints of water, and that it is black in colour, has a strong bouquet, and improves in substance with age.
