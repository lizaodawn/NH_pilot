for the art of painting had already been brought to perfection even in italy. at all events there survive even today in the temples at ardea paintings that are older than the city of rome, which to me at all events are incomparably remarkable, surviving for so long a period as though freshly painted, although unprotected by a roof. similarly at lanuvium, where there are an atalanta and a helena close together, nude figures, painted by the same artist, each of outstanding beauty (the former shown as a virgin), and not damaged even by the collapse of the temple. the emperor caligula from lustful motives attempted to remove them, but the consistency of the plaster would not allow this to be done. there are pictures surviving at caere that are even older. and whoever carefully judges these works will admit that none of the arts reached full perfection more quickly, inasmuch as it is clear that painting did not exist in the trojan period.
