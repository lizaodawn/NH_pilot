it was on account of this ialysus that king demetrius, in order to avoid burning a picture, abstained from setting fire to rhodes when the city could only be taken from the side where the picture was stored, and through consideration for the safety of a picture lost the chance of a victory! protogenes at the time was in his little garden on the outskirts of the city, that is in the middle of the camp of demetrius, and would not be interrupted by the battles going on, or on any account suspend the works he had begun, had he not been summoned by the king, who asked him what gave him the assurance to continue outside the walls. he replied that he knew the king was waging war with the rhodians, not with the arts. the king, delighted to be able to safeguard the hands which he had spared, placed guardposts to protect him, and, to avoid repeatedly calling him from his work, actually though an enemy came to pay him visits, and quitting his aspirations for his own victory, in the thick of battles and the battering down of walls, looked on at the work of an artist. and even to this day the story is attached to a picture of that date that protogenes painted it with a sword hanging over him. the picture is the one of a satyr, called the satyr reposing, and to give a final touch to the sense of security felt at the time, the figure holds a pair of flutes.
