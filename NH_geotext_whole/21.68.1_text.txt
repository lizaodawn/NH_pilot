the other plants of the same kind differ in the leaf: asphodel has an oblong, narrow leaf; the squill one broad and flexible; the gladiolus one that its name suggests. asphodel is used as food. both the seed and the bulb are roasted, but the second in hot ashes; salt and oil are added. it is also pounded with figs, which hesiod i thinks is a special delicacy. there is a tradition that if asphodel be planted before the gate of a country house it keeps away the evil influences of sorcery. homer also mentioned asphodel. its root is like a navew of moderate size, and no plant has more bulbs, eighty being often grouped together. theophrastus and the greeks generally, beginning with pythagoras, have given the name of anthericus to its stem, a cubit and often two cubits long, with leaves like those of wild leek; it is the root, that is to say the bulbs, that they call asphodel. we of italy call this plant albucus, and anthericus 'royal spear', the stem of which bears berries, and we distinguish two kinds. albueus has a stalk a cubit long, large, without leaves and smooth, which mago recommends should be cut at the end of march or the beginning of april, when the blossoming has ceased but before its seed has begun to swell; he adds that the stalks should be split, and brought out into the sun on the fourth day, and that of the material so dried bundles should be made. the same authority adds that the greeks call oistos, the plant which we include among sedge and call arrow. he recommends that from the fifteenth of may to the end of october it should be stripped of its skin and dried in mild sunshine, and also that the second kind of gladiolus, called cypiros, which too is a marsh plant, should be cut down to the root through out july, and on the third day dried in the sun until it turns white. every day however before sunset it should be put back under cover, since night dews are harmful to marsh plants after they have been cut down.
