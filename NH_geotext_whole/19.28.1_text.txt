the skirret also has been advertised by the emperor tiberius's requisitioning an annual supply of it from germany. there is a castle on the rhine called gelb where a specially fine kind of skirret grows, showing that cold localities suit it. it contains a core running through its whole length, which is drawn out when it has been boiled, though nevertheless a great part of its bitterness remains, which when it is used as a food is modified by adding wine sweetened with honey, and is actually turned into an attraction. the larger parsnip also contains a core of the same kind, though only when it is a year old. the time for sowing skirret is in the months of february, march, april, august, september and october.
