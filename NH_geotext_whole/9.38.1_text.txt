eels live eight years. they can even last five or six days at a time out of water if a north wind is blowing, but not so long with a south wind. but the same fish cannot endure winter in shallow nor in rough water; consequently they are chiefly caught at the rising of the pleiades as the rivers are then specially rough. they feed at night. they are the only fish that do not float on the surface when dead. there is a lake called garda in the territory of verona through which flows the river mincio, at the outflow of which on a yearly occasion, about the month of october, when the lake is made rough evidently by the autumn star, they are massed together by the waves and rolled in such a marvellous shoal that masses of fish, a thousand in each, are found in the receptacles constructed in the river for the purpose.
