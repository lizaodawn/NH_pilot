earthquakes are accompanied by inundations of the sea, which is presumably caused to flood the land by the same current of air, or drawn into the bosom of the earth as it subsides. the greatest earthquake in human memory occurred when tiberius caesar was emperor, twelve asiatic cities being overthrown in one night; the most numerous series of shocks was during the punic war, when reports reached rome of fifty-seven in a single year; it was the year when a violent earthquake occurring during an action between the carthaginian and roman armies at lake trasimene was not noticed by the combatants on either side. nor yet is the disaster a simple one, nor does the danger consist only in the earthquake itself, but equally or more in the fact that it is a portent; the city of rome was never shaken without this being a premonition of something about to happen.
