slime in water is bad. if however the same river is full of eels, it is held to be a sign of wholesomeness, as it is of coldness for worms to breed in a spring. but before all are condemned bitter waters, and those that give a full feeling immediately after drinking, as does the water at troezen. but the nitrous and salty-acid streams that in the desert flow to the red sea are made sweet within two hours if pearl barley is added, and the barley itself they eat. especially are condemned waters that have mud at their source, and those that give a bad colour to those who drink of them. it also makes a difference if water stains bronze vessels, or if it cooks greens slowly, if when gently filtered out it leaves a sediment of earth, or when boiled thickly encrusts the vessel. not only too is fetid water bad, but also that which tastes of anything at all, though the taste may be pleasant and agreeable, or, as often happens, approaching that of milk. wholesome water ought to be very like air. in the whole world one spring of water only is said to have a pleasant smell, and that is at chabura in mesopotamia; a reason is sought in the legend that with it juno was bathed. apart from this wholesome water should have no sort of taste or smell.
