we must not pass over a novelty that has also been invented, in that likenesses made, if not of gold or statues in silver, yet at all events of bronze are set up in the libraries in honour of those whose immortal spirits speak to us in the same places, nay more, even imaginary likenesses are modelled and our affection gives birth to countenances that have not been handed down to us, as occurs in the case of homer. at any rate in my view at all events there is no greater kind of happiness than that all people for all time should desire to know what kind of a man a person was. at rome this practice originated with asinius pollio, who first by founding a library made works of genius the property of the public.
