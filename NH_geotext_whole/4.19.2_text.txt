before leucimna we find the islands of sybota, and between leucadia and achaia a great number of islands, among which are those called teleboides, as also taphiae; by the natives, those which lie before leucadia are called by the names of taphias, oxiae, and prinoessa; while those that are in front of aitolia are the echinades, consisting of aegialia, cotonis, thyatira, geoaris, dionysia, cyrnus, chalcis, pinara, and mystus.
