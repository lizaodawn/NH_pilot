centaury is said to have been the treatment given to chiron when an arrow fell on his foot as he was handling the arms of hercules, who was his guest; for which reason some call it chironion. its leaves are broad and longish, serrated all round the edge; thickly from the root grow jointed stems three cubits high. on these are heads like those of poppies. the root is enormous and reddish, soft and easily broken, up to two cubits in size, streaming with juice and bitter with something of sweetness in it. it grows on hills with a rich soil, the most esteemed in arcadia, elis, messenia, pholoe and on mount lykaion; on the alps too and in very many other places. in lycia indeed they also make a lycium from it. its power to cure wounds is so strong that even pieces of meat, they say, coalesce if they are boiled with it. the part used is the root, the dose being for the patients for whom it will be prescribed two drachmae only. it should be pounded and taken in water if fever be present; those without fever should take it pounded but in wine. the juice of the decoction cures also the diseases of sheep.
