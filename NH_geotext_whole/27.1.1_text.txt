the mere treatment of this subject undoubtedly increases the admiration that i at least feel for the men of old; the greater the number of plants waiting to be described, the more one is led to revere the careful research of the ancients and their kindness in passing on the results. without a doubt even the bounteousness of nature herself might seem to have been surpassed by them in this way if the discoveries had been the result of human endeavour. but as it is, it is clear that this bounteousness has been the work of the gods, or at least due to their inspiration, even when the actual discoverer was a man, and that the same mother of all things both produced the herbs and made them known to us. this is the greatest miracle of life, if we care to admit the truth. to think that the scythian plant, for example, is brought from the marshes of maeotis, euphorbea from mount atlas and from beyond the pillars of hercules, where the works of nature actually begin to fail; on another side britannica, from islands in the ocean lying beyond the mainland, aethiopis too from the clime scorched by the constellations of heaven, and other plants moreover passing hither and thither from all quarters throughout the whole world for the welfare of mankind, all owing to the boundless grandeur of the roman peace, which displays in turn not men only with their different lands and tribes, but also mountains, and peaks soaring into the clouds, their offspring and also their plants. may this gift of the gods last, i pray, for ever! so truly do they seem to have given to the human race the romans as it were a second sun.
