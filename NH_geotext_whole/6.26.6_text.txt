two miles distant from alexandria is the town of juliopolis. the distance thence to coptos, up the nile, is three hundred and eight miles; the voyage is performed, when the etesian winds are blowing, in twelve days. from coptos the journey is made with the aid of camels, stations being arranged at intervals for the supply of fresh water. the first of these stations is called hydreuma, and is distant twenty-two miles; the second is situate on a mountain, at a distance of one day's journey from the last; the third is at a second hydreuma, distant from coptos ninety-five miles; the fourth is on a mountain; the next to that is at another hydreuma, that of apollo, and is distant from coptos one hundred and eighty-four miles; after which, there is another on a mountain. there is then another station at a place called the new hydreuma, distant from coptos two hundred and thirty miles: and next to it there is another, called the old hydreuma, or the troglodytic, where a detachment is always on guard, with a caravansary that affords lodging for two thousand persons. this last is distant from the new hydreuma seven miles. after leaving it we come to the city of berenice, situate upon a harbour of the red sea, and distant from coptos two hundred and fifty-seven miles. the greater part of this distance is generally travelled by night, on account of the extreme heat, the day being spent at the stations; in consequence of which it takes twelve days to perform the whole journey from coptos to berenice.
