it pays best for eggs to be sat on within ten days of laying; older or fresher ones are infertile. an odd number should be put under the hen. if three days after they began to be sat on the top of the eggs held in the tips of the fingers against the light shows a transparent colour of a single hue, the eggs are judged to be barren, and others should be substituted for them. they may also be tested in water: an empty egg floats, and consequently people prefer eggs that sink, that is, are full, to put under the hens. but they warn against their being tested by shaking, on the ground that if the vital veins are displaced the eggs are sterile. the ninth's day after a new moon is assigned for starting a hen's sitting, as eggs begun earlier do not hatch out. the chicks are hatched more quickly when the days are warm, and consequently eggs will hatch out in 18 days in summer but 24 in winter. if it thunders while the hen is sitting the eggs die, and if she hears the cry of a hawk they go bad. a remedy against thunder is an iron nail placed under the straw in which the eggs lie, or some earth from the plough. in some cases nature hatches of her own accord even without the hen sitting, as on the dunghills of egypt. we find a clever story about a certain toper at syracuse, that he used to go on drinking for as long a time as it would take for eggs covered with earth to produce a hatch.
