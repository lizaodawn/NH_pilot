the radish likes to be sown in loose, damp soil. it dislikes dung and is content with a dressing of chaff; and it is so fond of cold that in germany it grows as big as a baby child. radish for the spring crop is sown after february 13, and the second sowing, which is a better crop, is about the festival of vulcan; but many also sow it in march and april and in september. when it begins to make growth, it pays to bank up every other leaf on each plant and to earth up the roots themselves, as a root that projects above the ground becomes hard and full of holes. aristomachus advises stripping off the leaves during winter, and piling up earth round the plants to prevent muddy puddles forming round them; and he says that this will make them grow a good size in summer. some authors have stated that if a hole is made by driving in a stake and covered at the bottom with chaff to a depth of six inches, and a seed is sown in it and dung and earth are heaped on it, a radish grows to the size of the hole. all the same they find saltish soils specially nourishing, and so they are even watered with salt water, and in egypt, where they are remarkable for sweetness, they are sprinkled with soda. also brackishness has the effect of entirely removing their pungency, and making them like radishes that have been boiled, inasmuch as boiling a radish sweetens it and turns it into something like a navew.
