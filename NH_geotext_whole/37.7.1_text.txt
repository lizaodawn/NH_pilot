it was the same victory that brought myrrhine ware for the first time to rome. pompey was the first to dedicate myrrhine bowls and cups, which he set aside from the spoils of his triumphs for jupiter of the capitol. such vessels immediately passed into ordinary use, and there was a demand even for display stands a and tableware. lavish expenditure on this fashion is increasing every day ... an ex-consul, drank from a myrrhine cup for which he had given 70,000 sesterces, although it held just three pints. he was so fond of it that he would gnaw its rim; and yet the damage he thus caused only enhanced its value, and there is no other piece of myrrhine ware even today that has a higher price set upon it. the amount of money squandered by this same man upon the other articles of this material in his possession can be gauged from their number, which was so great that, when nero took them away from the man's children and displayed them, they filled the private theatre in his gardens across the tiber, a theatre which was large enough to satisfy even nero's desire to sing before a full house at the time when he was rehearsing for his appearance in pompey's theatre. it was at this time that i saw the pieces of a single broken cup included in the exhibition. it was decided that these, like the body of alexander, should be preserved in a kind of catafalque for display, presumably as a sign of the sorrows of the age and the ill-will of fortune. when the ex-consul titus petronius was facing death, he broke, to spite nero, a myrrhine dipper that had cost him 300,000 sesterces, thereby depriving the emperor's dining-room table of this legacy. nero, however, as was proper for an emperor, outdid everyone by paying 1,000,000 sesterces for a single bowl. that one who was acclaimed as a victorious general and as father of his country should have paid so much in order to drink is a detail that we must formally record.
