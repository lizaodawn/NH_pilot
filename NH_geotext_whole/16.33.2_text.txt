trees of the forest class that do not shed their leaves are the fir, larch, wild pine, juniper, cedar, turpentine, box, holm-oak, holly, cork, yew, tamarisk. between the evergreen and the deciduous classes are the andrachle growing in greece and the arbutus in all countries, for they shed all their leaves except those on the top of the tree. in the class of shrubs also a kind of cedar, the bramble and the cane do not shed their leaves. in the territory of thurii, where sybaris once stood, there was a single oak that was visible from the actual city which never shed its leaves and which did not bud before midsummer; and it is surprising that this fact having been published by greek authors has never subsequently been mentioned among ourselves. the fact is that the influence of some localities is so great that in the neighbourhood of memphis in egypt and at elephantine in the thebaid none of the trees shed their leaves, not even the vines.
