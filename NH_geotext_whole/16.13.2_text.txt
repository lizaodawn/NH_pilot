the cork is a very small tree, and its acorns are very bad in quality and few in number; its only useful product is its bark, which is extremely thick and which when cut grows again; when flattened out it has been known to form a sheet as big as 10 feet square. this bark is used chiefly for ships' anchor drag-ropes and fishermen's dragnets and for the bungs of casks, and also to make soles for women's winter shoes. consequently the greek name for the tree is 'bark-tree,' which is not inappropriate. some people also call it the female holm-oak, and in places where the holm-oak does not grow, for instance in the districts of elis and sparta, use cork-tree timber instead of holm-oak, especially for wain-wright's carpentry. it does not grow all over italy or anywhere in gaul.
