linen cloths were used in the theatres as awnings, a plan first invented by quintus catulus when dedicating the capitol. next lentulus spinther is recorded to have been the first to stretch awnings of cambric in the theatre, at the games of apollo. soon afterwards caesar when dictator stretched awnings [49-44 b.c.]. over the whole of the roman forum, as well as the sacred way from his mansion, and the slope right up to the capitol, a display recorded to have been thought more wonderful even than the show of gladiators which he gave. next even when there was no display of games marcellus the son of augustus's sister octavia, during his period of office as aedile, in the eleventh consulship of his uncle, from the first of august onward fixed awnings of sailcloth over the forum, so that those engaged in lawsuits might resort there under healthier conditions: what a change this was from the stern manners of cato the ex-censor, who had expressed the view that even the forum ought to be paved with sharp pointed stones! recently awnings actually of sky blue and spangled with stars have been stretched with ropes even in the emperor nero's amphitheatres. red awnings are used in the inner courts of houses and keep the sun off the moss growing there; but for other purposes white has remained persistently in favour. moreover as early as the trojan war linen already held a place of honour - for why should it not be present even in battles as it is in shipwrecks? homer testifies that warriors, though only a few, fought in linen corslets. this material was also used for rigging ships, according to the same author as interpreted by the more learned scholars, who say that the word sparta used by homer means 'sown'.
