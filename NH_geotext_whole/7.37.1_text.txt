the people who have achieved distinction in the knowledge of the various sciences are innumerable, but nevertheless they must be touched on when we are culling the flower of mankind: in astronomy, berosus, to whom on account of his marvellous predictions athens officially erected in the gymnasium a statue with a gilt tongue; philology, apollodorus, whom the amphictyons of greece honoured; in medicine, hippocrates, who foretold a plague that was coming from illyria and despatched his pupils round the cities to render assistance, in return for which service greece voted him the honours that it gave to hercules. the same knowledge in the case of cleombrotus of ceos was rewarded by king ptolemy at the megalensian festival with 100 talents, after he had saved the life of king antiochus. critobulus also has a great reputation for having extracted an arrow from king philip's eye, and having treated his loss of sight without causing disfigurement of his face; but the highest reputation belongs to asclepiades of prusa, for having founded a new school, despised the envoys and overtures of king mithridates, discovered a method of preparing medicated wine for the sick, brought back a man from burial and saved his life, but most of all for having made a wager with fortune that he should not be deemed a physician if he were ever in any way ill himself: and he won his bet, as he lost his life in extreme old age by falling downstairs.
