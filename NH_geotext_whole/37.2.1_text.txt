hence arose the esteem in which gemstones are held; and this soared into such a passion that to polycrates of samos, the overlord of islands and coasts, the voluntary sacrifice of a single gemstone seemed a sufficient atonement for his prosperity, which even he himself, the happy recipient, owned to he excessive. thereby he hoped to settle his account with the fickleness of fortune. clearly he supposed that he would be fully indemnified against her ill-will if he, who was weary of unremitting happiness, suffered this one unhappy experience. accordingly, he put out in a boat and threw the ring into deep water. the ring, however, was seized as bait by a huge fish, fit for a king, which restored the ring as an evil omen to its owner in his own kitchen, thanks to fortune's treacherous intervention. the gem, it is agreed, was a sardonyx and is displayed in rome (if we can believe that this is the original stone) in the temple of concord, set in a golden horn. it was presented by the empress and is ranked almost last in a collection containing many gems that are valued more highly.
