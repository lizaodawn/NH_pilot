not even in egypt does the ebony-tree grow, as i have stated, and in my medical research i omit foreign regions; yet i must not pass it by, as it is a great marvel. its sawdust is said to be a sovereign remedy for the eyes; its wood, ground on the whetstone and mixed with raisin wine, to dispel dimness of vision; its root, applied however in water, to disperse white specks on the eyes; cough too to be cleared away if an equal measure of draeunculus root is added along with honey. physicians include ebony among erosive remedies.
