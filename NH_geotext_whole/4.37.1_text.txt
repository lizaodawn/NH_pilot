the general measurement of europe: having thus made the circuit of europe, we must now give the complete measurement of it, in order that those who wish to be acquainted with this subject may not feel themselves at a loss. artemidorus and isidorus have given its length, from the tanais to gades, as 8214 miles. polybius in his writings has stated the breadth of europe, in a line from italy to the ocean, to be 1150 miles. but, even in his day, its magnitude was but little known. the distance of italy, as we have previously stated, as far as the alps, is 1120 miles, from which, through lugdunum to the british port of the morini, the direction which polybius seems to follow, is 1168 miles. but the better ascertained, though greater length, is that taken from the alps through the camp of the legions in germany, in a north-westerly direction, to the mouth of the rhine, being 1543 miles. we shall now have to speak of africa and asia.
