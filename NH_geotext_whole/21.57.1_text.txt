and cactos also grows only in sicily; it too has peculiar properties of its own. its stems, shooting out from the root, trail on the ground; the leaves are broad and prickly. the stems are called cacti, which make, even when preserved, a palatable food. one kind, however, has an upright stem called pternix, of the same pleasant flavour, but it will not keep. the seed is downy, the down being called pappus. when the seeds have been taken away and the rind, there remains something as tender as the brain of the palm. it is called ascalia.
