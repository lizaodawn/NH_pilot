nor will i pass by the birds of diomedes. juba calls them plungers-birds, also reporting that they have teeth, and that their eyes are of a fiery red colour but the rest of them bright white. he states that they always have two leaders, one of whom leads the column and the other brings up the rear; that they hollow out trenches with their beaks and then roof them over with lattice and cover this with the earth that they have previously dug from the trenches and in these they hatch their eggs; that the trenches of all of them have two doors, that by which they go out to forage facing east and that by which they return west; and that when about to relieve themselves they always fly upwards and against the wind. these birds are commonly seen in only one place in the whole world, in the island which we spoke of as famous for the tomb and shrine of diomedes, off the coast of apulia, and they resemble coots. barbarian visitors they beset with loud screaming, and they pay deference only to greeks, a remarkable distinction, as if paying this tribute to the race of diomede; and every day they wash and purify the temple mentioned by filling their throats with water and wetting their wings; which is the source of the legend that the comrades of diomedes were transformed into the likeness of these birds.
