syria also has the turpentine-tree. of this the male variety has no fruit, but the female has two kinds of fruit, one of them ruddy and the size of a lentil, while the other is pale, and ripens at the same time as the grape; it is no larger in size than a bean, has a rather agreeable scent, and is sticky to the touch. round mount ida in the troad and in macedonia this is a low-growing shrub-like tree, but at damascus in syria it is big. its wood is fairly flexible and remains sound to a great age; it is of a shiny black colour. the flower grows in clusters like the olive, but is crimson in colour, and the foliage is thick. it also bears follicles out of which come insects resembling gnats, and which produce a sticky resinous fluid which also bursts out from its bark.
