beet is the smoothest of the garden plants. the greeks distinguish two kinds of beet also, according to the colour, black and whitish - they prefer the latter, which has a very scanty supply of seed, and call it sicilian beet; indeed they prefer lettuce also with distinctive quality of whiteness. our people distinguish two kinds of beet according to time of sowing, spring beet and autumn beet, although beet is also sown in june, and the plant transplanted in autumn. beets also like even their roots to be smeared with dung, and have, a similar liking for a damp place. beets are also made into a salad with lentils and beans, and are dressed in the same way as cabbages, the best way being to stimulate their insipidity with the bitterness of mustard. the doctors have pronounced beet to be more unwholesome than cabbage, on account of which there are persons who scruple even to taste beets when served at table; and consequently they are preferably an article of diet for people with strong digestions. beets have a double structure, that of the cabbage, and, at the actual head of the root as it springs up, that of an onion. they are most valued for width, which is secured, as in lettuces, by placing a light weight on them when they have begun to assume their colour. no other garden plant grows broader: occasionally beets spread out to two feet across, the nature of the soil also contributing a great deal to this, inasmuch as the widest spreading beets grow in the territory of circeii. some people think that beets are best sown when the pomegranate is in blossom, and transplanted when they have begun to make five leaves; and that by a remarkable difference (if this really exists) white beet acts as a purge and black beet as an astringent; and that when the flavour of wine in a cask is getting spoiled by 'cabbage' it can be restored to what it was by plunging in some leaves of beet.
