there were no bakers at rome down to the war with king perseus, [171-168 bc] over 580 years after the foundation of the city. the citizens used to make bread themselves, and this was especially the task of the women, as it is even now in most nations. plautus already speaks of bakers, using the greek word, in his play named aulularia, which has caused great debate among the learned as to the authenticity of the line, and it is proved by the expression occurring in ateius capito that it was in his day usual for bread to be baked for more luxurious people by cooks, and only those who ground spelt were called 'grinders'; nor used people to have cooks on their regular staff of servants, but they hired them from the provision market. the gallic provinces invented the kind of bolter noade of horse-hair, while spain made sieves and meal-sifters of flax, and egypt of papyrus and rush.
