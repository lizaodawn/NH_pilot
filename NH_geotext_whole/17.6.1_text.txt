there are several varieties of dung, and its actual employment dates a long way back; as far back as homer an aged king in the poem is found thus enriching his land with his own hands. the invention of this procedure is traditionally ascribed to king augeas in greece, and its introduction in italy to hercules, though italy has immortalized stercutus son of faunus on account of this invention. marcus varro gives the first rank to thrushes' droppings from aviaries, which he also extols for fodder of cattle and swine, declaring that no other fodder fattens them more quickly. if our ancestors had such large aviaries that they supplied manure for the fields, it is possible to be hopeful about our own morals! but columella puts manure from dovecots first, and next manure from the poultry-yard, condemning the droppings of water birds entirely. the rest of the authorities advocate the residue of human banquets as one of the best manures, and some of them place even higher the residue of men's drink, with hair found in curriers shops soaked in it, while others recommend this liquor by itself, after water has been again mixed with it and even in larger quantity than when the wine is being drunk; the fact being that a larger amount of badness has to be overcome in the liquor when to the original poison of the wine the human factor has been added. these are contested questions; and they use man even for nourishing soil. next to this kind of manure the dung of swine is highly commended columella alone condemning it. others recommend the dung of any quadruped that feeds on clover, but some prefer pigeons' droppings. next comes the dung of goats, after that sheep's dung, then cow-dung and last of all that of beasts of burden.
