ferns are of two kinds, neither having blossom or seed. some greeks call pteris, others blachnon, the kind from the sole root of which shoot out several other ferns exceeding even two cubits in length, with a not unpleasant smell. this is considered male. the other kind the greeks call thelypteris, some nymphaea pteris. it has only one stem, and is not bushy, but shorter, softer and more compact than the other, and channelled with leaves at the root. the root of both kinds fattens pigs. in both kinds the leaves are pinnate on either side, whence the greeks have named them pteris. the roots of both are long, slanting, and blackish, especially when they have lost moisture; they should, however, be dried in the sun. ferns grow everywhere, but especially in a cold soil. they ought to be dug up at the setting of the pleiades. the root must be used only at the end of three years, neither earlier nor later. ferns expel intestinal worms, tapeworms when taken with honey, but for other worms they must be taken in sweet wine on three consecutive days; both kinds are very injurious to the stomach. fern opens the bowels, bringing away first bile, then fluid. tapeworms better with an equal weight of scammony. to treat catarrhal fluxes two oboli by weight of the root are taken in water after fasting for one day, with a taste of honey beforehand. neither fern should be given to women, since either causes a miscarriage when they are pregnant, and barrenness when they are not. reduced to powder they are sprinkled over foul ulcers as well as on the necks of draught animals. the leaves kill lice and will not harbour snakes, so that it is well to spread them in suspected places; by the smell too when burnt they drive away these creatures. among ferns also physicians have their preference; the macedonian is the best, the next best comes from cassiope?
