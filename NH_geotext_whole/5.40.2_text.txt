this country was at first called by the name of cronia, after that, thessalis, and then malianda and strymonis. the people of it are by homer called halizones, from the fact that it was a nation begirt by the sea. there was formerly a vast city here, attussa by name; at present there are twelve cities in existence; among which is gordiucome, otherwise juliopolis; and, on the coast, dascylos. we then come to the river gelbes; and, in the interior, the town of helgas, or germanicopolis, which has also the other name of booseoete apamea, now more generally known as myrlea of the colophonians: the river etheleus also. the ancient boundary of troas, and the commencement of mysia. next to this comes the gulf into which the river ascanius flows, the town of bryllion, and the rivers hylas and cius, with a town of the same name as the last-mentioned river; it was founded by the milesians at a place which was called ascania of phrygia, as an entrepot for the trade of the phrygians who dwelt in the vicinity. we may therefore look upon this as a not ineligible opportunity for making further mention of phrygia.
