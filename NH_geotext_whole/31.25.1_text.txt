the same agrippa also brought the aqua virgo to rome from the byroad, eight miles away, that extends two miles along the road to praeneste. nearby is the stream of hercules, and because the aqua virgo runs away from this it was so named. a comparison of these rivers illustrates the difference mentioned above; for the aqua marcia is as much superior to swallow as the aqua virgo is cool to touch. and yet rome has long since lost the delights of each, for love of display and greed have diverted these means of public health to country seats and suburbs.
