some persons have wished to make out that sinopis only consists in a kind of red-ochre of inferior quality, as they gave the palm to the red ochre of lemnos. this last approximates very closely to cinnabar and it was very famous in old days, together with the island that produces it; it used only to be sold in sealed packages, from which it got the name of 'seal red-ochre.' it is used to supply an undercoating to cinnabar and also for adulterating cinnabar. in medicine it is a substance ranked very highly. used as a liniment round the eyes it relieves defluxions and pains, and checks the discharge from eye-tumours; it is given in vinegar as a draught in cases of vomiting or spitting blood. it is also taken as a draught for troubles of the spleen and kidneys and for excessive menstruation; and likewise as a remedy for poisons and snake bites and the sting of sea serpents; hence it is in common use for all antidotes.
