among the bright colourless stones there is also the one called 'ceraunia' ('thunder-stone') which catches the glitter of the stars and, although in itself it is like rock-crystal, has a brilliant blue sheen. it is found in carmania. zenothemis admits that it is colourless, but describes it as 'containing a twinkling star.' he mentions that there are also to be found dull 'cerauniae' which if steeped in soda and vinegar for several days form such a star, which, however, fades away again after as many months. sotacus distinguishes also two other varieties of the stone, a black and a red, resembling axe-heads. according to him, those among them that are black and round are supernatural objects; and he states that thanks to them cities and fleets are attacked and overcome, their name being 'baetuli,' while the elongated stones are 'cerauniae.' these writers distinguish yet another kind of 'ceraunia' which is quite rare. according to them, the magi hunt for it zealously because it is found only in a place that has been struck by a thunderbolt.
