this belongs to the nile; it is a curse on four legs, and equally pernicious on land and in the river. it is the only land animal not furnished with a tongue and the only one that bites by pressing down the mobile upper jaw, and it is also formidable because of its row of teeth set close together like a comb. in size it usually exceeds 18 ells. it lays as many eggs as a goose, and by a kind of prophetic instinct incubates them always outside the line to which the nile in that year is going to rise at full flood. nor does any other animal grow to greater dimensions from a smaller original size; however, it is armed with talons as well, and its hide is invincible against all blows. it passes its days on land and its nights in the water, in both eases for reasons of warmth. this creature when sated with a meal of fish and sunk in sleep on the shore with its mouth always full of food, is tempted by a small bird (called there the trochilus, but in italy the king-bird) to open its mouth wide to enable the bird to feed; and first it hops in and cleans out the mouth, and then the teeth and inner throat also, [fictitious] which yawns open as wide as possible for the pleasure of this scratching; and the ichneumon watches for it to be overcome by sleep in the middle of this gratification and darts like a javelin through the throat so opened and gnaws out the belly.
