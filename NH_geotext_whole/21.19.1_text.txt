this distinction too must not be forgotten, that many flowers, in spite of their perfume, are of no use for chaplets, for example, the iris and celtic nard, although both have an exquisite perfume. but the iris is valued only for its root, being grown for unguents and for medicine. the most highly esteemed is found in illyria, and even there not in the coastal districts, but in the woody parts near the drinon and around narona. next after it comes the macedonian iris, which is white, thin and very long. third in estimation comes the african iris, which is the largest of all and the bitterest to the taste. the illyrian moreover is of two kinds: raphanitis, so called from its likeness to the radish, which is the better kind, and rhizotomos. the best, which is reddish, causes sneezing if handled, and has an upright stem a cubit high. the flower is multicoloured, like the rainbow; hence the name 'iris'.
