besides these the distinction of the grass crown has been won for service in sicily by m. calpurnius flamma, tribune of the soldiers, and in the war with the cimbri by cn. petreius of atina, the only centurion to receive it up to the present time. serving as head centurion under catulus, he harangued his legion when it was cut off by the enemy, killed his own tribune when he hesitated to break through the enemy camp, and brought the legion out. i find in my authorities that in addition to this honour the same man, with the consuls marius and catulus at his side, offered sacrifice, wearing the magisterial gown, on a brazier placed for the purpose, and to the music of the piper. sulla the dictator also has written that he too was presented by his army with this crown before nola, when he was lieutenant-general in the marsian war, and moreover had the scene painted in his tusculan villa, afterwards the property of cicero. if sulla tells the truth, it would make me describe him as all the more detestable, because by his proscription he with his own hand tore the crown from his own head, so much fewer were the citizens he saved than those whom he afterwards slew. let him also add to this distinction the proud surname of felix, nevertheless he himself resigned to sertorius this crown when he besieged the proscribed in every part of the world. scipio aemilianus also was, according to varro, presented with the siege crown in africa when manilius was consul, having rescued three cohorts with three others led out to rescue them. such is the story carved under scipio's statue by augustus, now in heaven, in the forum augusti. augustus himself, in the consulship of marcus cicero junior, was on the 13th september presented with the siege crown by the senate; so inadequate was the civic crown thought to be. nobody else at all, i find, has received this distinction.
