democritus goes on to mention another plant, the adamantis, a native of armenia and cappadocia; if it be placed, he says, near lions they lie on their backs and wearily yawn. the reason for the name is because the plant cannot be crushed, ariana is given as the home of the arianis, a plant of the colour of fire. it is gathered, he says, when the sun is in leo, and pieces of wood soaked in oil catch fire at its touch.
