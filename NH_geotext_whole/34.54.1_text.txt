'psimithium' also, that is cerussa or lead of acetate, is produced at lead-works. the most highly spoken of is in rhodes. it is made from very fine shavings of lead placed over a vessel of very sour vinegar and so made to drip down. what falls from the lead into the actual vinegar is dried and then ground and sifted, and then again mixed with vinegar and divided into tablets and dried in the sun, in summertime. there is also another way of making it, by putting the lead into jars of vinegar kept sealed up for ten days and then scraping off the sort of decayed metal on it and putting it back in the vinegar, till the whole of it is used up. the stuff scraped off is ground up and sifted and heated in shallow vessels and stirred with small rods till it turns red and becomes like sandarach, realgar. then it is washed with fresh water till all the cloudy impurities have been removed. afterwards it is dried in a similar way and divided into tablets. its properties are the same as those of the substances mentioned above, only it is the mildest of them all, and beside that, it is useful for giving women a fair complexion; but like scum of silver, it is a deadly poison. the lead acetate itself if afterwards melted becomes red.
