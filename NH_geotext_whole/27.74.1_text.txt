among all plants nothing is more wonderful than lithospermum, called by some exonychon, by others 'juppiter's corn,' and by others 'corn of hercules.' the plant is about five inches high, with leaves twice as big as those of rue, and ligneous little branches of the thickness of a rush. near the leaves it grows as it were little beards, which are single, and on their tops little stones, white and round as pearls, as big as a chick-pea but as hard as a stone. where they are attached to pedicels these jewels have little holes, in which is the seed. the plant grows indeed in italy, but the most highly valued in crete, and i have never seen anything among plants that filled me with greater wonder. so charming the adornment that one might think that the jeweller's art had arranged gleaming white pearls symmetrically among the leaves; very exquisite and difficult the birth of a gem from a plant! the authorities say that it lies and spreads over the ground; have seen it only when gathered, not when so growing. it is indisputable that a drachma by weight of these jewels taken in white wine breaks up and brings away stone, and cures strangury. there is no other plant the medicinal property of which can be recognised with greater confidence; its very appearance is such that at once by a glance, even without being told, people can become aware of this property.
