on a hill named corne in the territory of tusculum, near the city, there is a grove named corne which has been held in reverence from early times by the district of latium as sacred to diana; it consists of a beech coppice the foliage of which has the appearance of having been trimmed by art. this grove contains one outstanding tree which in our generation excited the affection of the orator passienus crispus, who had twice been consul and who subsequently became still more distinguished by marrying agrippina and becoming the stepfather of nero; crispus used regularly not merely to lie beneath the tree and to pour wine over it, but to kiss and embrace it. close to this grove is a holm-oak which is also famous, as measuring thirty-four feet round the trunk, and sending out what look like ten separate trees of remarkable size and forming a wood of itself.
