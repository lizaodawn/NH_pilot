the right of controlling the sale of cinnamon is vested solely in the king of the gebbanitae, who opens the market by public proclamation. the prices formerly were 1000 denarii a pound, but this was raised to half as much again after the forests had been burnt, so it is said, by infuriated barbarians; but it is not absolutely certain whether this was incendiarism provoked by injustice on the part of those in power or was due to accident, as we find it stated in the authorities that the south winds that blow there are so hot that they set lire to the forests in summer. his majesty the emperor vespasian was the first person to dedicate in the temples of the capitol and of peace chaplets of cinnamon surrounded with embossed gold. we once saw in the temple of the palatine erected in honour of his late majesty augustus by his consort augusta a very heavy cinnamon-root placed in a golden bowl, out of which drops used to distil every year which hardened into grains; this went on until the shrine in question was destroyed by fire.
