there are also occurrences related to the laurel that are worth recalling in connexion with his late majesty augustus. when livia drusilla, who afterwards received the name of augusta on her marriage, had been betrothed to caesar, while she was seated an eagle dropped into her lap from the sky a hen of remarkable whiteness, without hurting it; she regarded it with wonder, but undismayed, and there was a further miracle: it was holding in its beak a laurel branch bearing its berries. so the augurs ordered that the bird and any chickens it produced should be preserved, and that the branch should be planted in the ground and guarded with religious care. this was done at the country mansion of the caesars standing on the banks of the river tiber about nine miles out on the flaminian road; the house is consequently called the poultry, and the laurel grove so begun has thriven in a marvellous way. afterwards the emperor when going in a triumph held a laurel branch from the original tree in his hand and wore a wreath of its foliage on his head, and subsequently every one of the ruling caesars did the same; and the custom was established of planting the branches which they had held, and groves of laurels distinguished by their names still survive; and it was perhaps in consequence of this that the change was made in the laurels worn in triumphs.
