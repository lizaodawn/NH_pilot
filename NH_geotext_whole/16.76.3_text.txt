what is believed to have been the largest tree ever seen at rome down to the present time was one that tiberius caesar caused to be exhibited as a marvel on the deck of the naval sham fight before mentioned; it had been brought to rome with the rest of the timber used, and it lasted till the amphitheatre of the emperor nero. it was a log of larchwood, 120 feet long and of a uniform thickness of two feet, from which could be inferred the almost incredible height of the rest of the tree by calculating its length to the top. within our own memory there was also an equally marvellous tree left by marcus agrippa in the porticos of the voting-booths, left over from the timber used for the ballot office; this was twenty feet shorter than the one previously mentioned, and 18 inches in thickness. an especially wonderful fir was seen in the ship which brought from egypt at the order of the emperor gaius the obelisk erected in the vatican circus and four shafts of the same stone to serve as its base. it is certain that nothing more wonderful than this ship has ever been seen on the sea: it carried one hundred and twenty bushels of lentils for ballast, and its length took up a large part of the left side of the harbour of ostia, for under the emperor claudius it was sunk there, with three moles as high as towers erected upon it that had been made of pozzuoli cement for the purpose and conveyed to the place. it took four men to span the girth of this tree with their arms; and we commonly hear that masts for those purposes cost 80,000 sesterces and more, and that to put together the rafts usually runs to 40,000. but in egypt and syria for want of fir the kings are said to have used cedar wood for their fleets; the largest cedar is reported to have been grown in cyprus and to have been felled to make a mast for a galley with rowers in teams of eleven belonging to demetrius; it was one hundred and thirty feet long and took three men to span its girth. the pirates of germany voyage in boats made of a single tree hollowed out, some of which carry as many as thirty people.
