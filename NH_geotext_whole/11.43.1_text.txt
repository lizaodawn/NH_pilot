the river hypanis on the black sea at midsummer brings down some thin membranes that look like berries out of which burst a four-legged caterpillar in the manner of the creature mentioned above, but it does not live beyond one day, owing to which it is called the hemerobius. the rest of this sort of creatures have from start to finish seven-day periods, but the gnat and maggots have twenty-one-day, and those whose offspring are fully formed twenty-eight-day periods. their changes and transformations into other shapes take place every three or every four days. the remaining kinds of this class possessing wings usually die in autumn of decay of the wings, but horseflies die of blindness also. when flies have been killed by damp they can be resuscitated by being buried in ashes.
