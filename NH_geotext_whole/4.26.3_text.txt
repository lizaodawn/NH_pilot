the sea runs in here and forms a large gulf, until there is only an intervening space of five miles between it and the lake maeotis, its margin forming the sea-line of extensive tracts of land, and numerous nations; it is known as the gulf of carcinites. here we find the river pacyris, the towns of navarum and carcine, and behind it lake buges, which discharges itself by a channel into the sea. this buges is separated by a ridge of rocks from coretus, a gulf in the lake maeotis; it receives the rivers buges, gerrus, and hypacaris, which approach it from regions that lie in various directions. for the gerrus separates the basilidae from the nomades, the hypacaris flows through the nomades and the hylaei, by an artificial channel into lake buges, and by its natural one into the gulf of coretus: this region bears the name of scythia sindice.
