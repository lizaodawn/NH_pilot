the lesser and the greater armenia: greater armenia, beginning at the mountains known as the paryadres, is separated, as we have already stated, from cappadocia by the river euphrates, and, where that river turns off in its course, from mesopotamia, by the no less famous river tigris. both of these rivers take their rise in armenia, which also forms the commencement of mesopotamia, a tract of country which lies between these streams; the intervening space between them being occupied by the arabian orei. it thus extends its frontier as far as adiabene, at which point it is stopped short by a chain of mountains which takes a cross direction; whereupon the province extends in width to the left, crossing the course of the araxes, as far as the river cyrus; while in length it reaches as far as the lesser armenia, from which it is separated by the river absarus, which flows into the euxine, and by the mountains known as the paryadres, in which the absarus takes its rise.
