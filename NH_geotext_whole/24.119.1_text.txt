there are some who speak of three kinds of pointed grass. when on each head there are at most five points they call it fixiger grass.; these points plaited together they insert into the nostrils and draw them out again to cause bleeding. the second kind, which is like the aizotim, they use with axle-grease for whitlows, hangnails, and when flesh has grown over the nails, calling it finger grass, because it heals the fingers. there is a third kind of finger grass, but it is slender, growing on ruins or tiles. its properties are caustic, and it checks creeping ulcers. grass put round the head checks copious bleeding at the nose. it is said that in the district of babylon camels are killed by the grass that grows by the side of the roads.
