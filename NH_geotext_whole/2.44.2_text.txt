the windings of mountains and their clustered peaks and ridges curved in an elbow or broken off into shoulders, and the hollow recesses of valleys, cleaving with their irregular contours the air that is consequently reflected from them (a phenomenon that in many place causes words spoken to be endlessly echoed) are productive of winds. so again are caverns, like the one with an enormous gaping mouth on the coast of dalmatia, from which, if you throw some light object into it, even in calm weather a gust like a whirlwind bursts out; the name of the place is senta. also it is said that in the province of cyrenaica there is a certain cliff, sacred to the south wind, which it is sacrilege for the hand of man to touch, the south wind immediately causing a sandstorm. even manufactured vessels in many houses if shut up in the dark have peculiar exhalations. thus there must be some cause for this.
