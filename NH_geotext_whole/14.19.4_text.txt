among the plants grown in gardens, wine is made from the root of asparagus, and from cunila, wild-marjoram, parsley-seed, southernwood, wild mint, rue, eatmint, wild thyme and horehound; they put two handfuls of herb into a jar of must, together with a pint of boiled-down grape-juice and half a pint of seawater. a wine is made from the navew turnip by adding two drams' weight of navew to a quart of must, and in the same way from the root of the squill; and, among flowers, from pounded rose-leaves wrapped in a linen napkin and thrown into must with a small weight attached to make it sink, in the proportion of 50 drams of rose-leaves to 24 gallons of must - they say the jar must not be opened for three months - and also wine is made from gallic nard and another from wild nard. i also find that aromatic wine is constantly made from almost exactly the same ingredients as perfumes - first from myrrh, as we have said, next also from celtic nard, reed and aspalathus, cakes of which are thrown into must or sweet wine; and in other places, from reed, sweet rush, costus, syrian nard, cardamom, bark and flowers of cinnamon, saffron, dates and foal-foot, similarly made up in the form of a cake; and among other people also from a mixture of half a pound of nard and cinnamon-leaf added to a gallon and a half of must; and this is also how at the present day what some people call savoury wines and others peppered wines are made by adding pepper and honey. we also find mention of nectar-wine, extracted from the plant which some call sunflower, others herb of media, or symphyton or herb of ida or orestion or nectaria, the root of which is added in the proportion of 50 drams to 6 pints of must, after being similarly wrapped in a linen napkin. of the remaining herbs, wormwood wine is made by boiling down a pound of pontic wormwood in five gallons of must to one-third of its amount, or else by putting shoots of wormwood into wine. similarly hyssop wine is made of cilician hyssop by throwing three ounces of hyssop into a gallon and a half of wine, or, if the hyssop is first pounded, into three-quarters of a gallon. each of these wines may also be made in another way, by sowing the plant round the roots of vines. also cato shows how to make hellebore wine in the same way by using black hellebore; also the same method is used in making scammony wine, vines having a remarkable property of drawing into themselves the flavour of some other plant, which explains why the grapes plucked in the marshes of padua actually have a flavour of willow. similarly in thasos also hellebore is planted among the vines, or else wild cucumber or scammony; the wine so obtained is called by a greek name denoting miscarriage, because it produces abortion.
