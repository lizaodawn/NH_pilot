aviaries with cages containing all kinds of birds were first set up by marcus laenius strabo of the order of knighthood at brindisi. from him began our practice of imprisoning within bars living creatures to which nature had assigned the open sky. nevertheless the most remarkable instance in this record is the dish belonging to the tragic actor clodius aesop, rated at the value of 100,000 sesterces, in which he served birds that sang some particular song or talked with human speech, which he acquired at the price of 6000 sesterces apiece, led by no other attraction except the desire to indulge in a sort of cannibalism in eating these birds, and not even showing any respect for that lavish fortune of his, even though won by his voice - in fact a worthy father of a son whom we have spoken of as swallowing pearls, though not so much so as to make me wish to give a true decision in the competition in baseness between the two, unless in so far as it is a smaller thing to have dined on the most bounteous resources of nature than on the tongues of men.
