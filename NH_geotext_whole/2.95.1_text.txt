for let earthquakes not be mentioned, and every case where at least the tombs of cities survive, and at the same time let us tell of the marvels of the earth rather than the crimes of nature. and, i will swear, not even the heavenly phenomena could have been more difficult to recount: the wealth of mines so varied, so opulent, so prolific, brought to the surface in so many ages, although every day all over the world so much devastation is wrought by fires, collapse of buildings, shipwrecks, wars, frauds, and so great is the consumption of luxury and of the multitudes of mankind; such a variety of patterned gems, such many-coloured markings in stones, and among them the brilliance of a certain stone a that only allows actual daylight to penetrate through it; the profusion of medicinal springs; the flames of fire flickering up in so many places, unceasing for so many centuries; the lethal breaths either emitted from chasms or due to the mere formation of the ground, in some places fatal only to birds, as in the region of soracte near rome, in others to all living creatures except man, and sometimes to man also, as in the territory of sinuessa and of pozzuoli - the places called breathing holes, or by other people jaws of hell - ditches that exhale a deadly breath; also the place near the temple of mephitis at ampsanctus in the hirpinian district, on entering which people die; likewise the hole at hierapolis in asia, harmless only to the priest of the great mother; elsewhere prophetic caves, those intoxicated by whose exhalations foretell the future, as at the very famous oracle at delphi. in these matters what other explanation could any mortal man adduce save that they are caused by the divine power of that nature which is diffused throughout the universe, repeatedly bursting out in different ways?
