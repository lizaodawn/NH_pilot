in egypt and in cyprus are mulberries of a unique sort, as i have already said. if the outer rind be peeled off they stream with copious juice; a deeper cut (so wonderful is their nature) finds them dry. the juice counteracts the poison of snakes, is good for dysentery, disperses superficial abscesses and all kinds of gatherings, heals wounds, and allays headache and earache. for diseases of the spleen it is taken by the mouth and used as a liniment, as also for violent chills. it very quickly breeds worms. we romans use the juice quite as much. taken in wine it neutralizes aconite and the poison of spiders; it opens the bowels, expelling phlegm, tapeworm and similar intestinal parasites. the same effect also is produced by the pounded bark. the leaves boiled in rain water together with the bark of the dark fig and of the vine dye the hair. the juice of the fruit itself moves the bowels immediately; the fruit itself is for the time being good for the stomach, being cooling, though thirst-producing, and if no other food is taken afterwards, it swells up. the juice of unripe mulberries is constipating; there are marvels to be noticed about this tree, mentioned by me in my description of it, which suggest that it has some sort of soul.
