closely related to omphacium is oenanthe, a product of the wild vine; i have spoken about it in my account of unguents. the most popular is to be found in syria, in particular from the white vine around the mountains of antioch and laodicea. it is cooling and astringent, is sprinkled on wounds and applied to the stomach, being also useful as a diuretic, for pains in the liver or head, for dysentery, coeliac affections and cholera; for nausea a dose of one obolus is taken in vinegar. it dries up running eruptions on the head, and being very efficacious for affections in moist parts of the body is used with honey and saffron for sores in the mouth and for complaints of the genitals and anus. it checks looseness of the bowels, heals scabrous eyelids and running eyes; taken in wine it cures a disordered stomach, and in cold water the spitting of blood. its ash is valued for eye-salves, and for cleansing sores, also for whitlows and pterygia. it is burned in an oven until a loaf would be thoroughly cooked. massaris is produced only for use in perfumes, and all such preparations have been made famous by the greed of the human spirit in its haste to seize them before the proper season.
