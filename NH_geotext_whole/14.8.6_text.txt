but also the wines of italy grown further away from the ausonian sea are not without note, those of taranto and servitia, and those grown at cosenza and tempsa and bari, and the lucanian vintages, which hold a better place than those of thurii. but the wines of lagara, grown not far from grumentum, are the most famous of them all, on the ground of their having restored the health of messala potitius. campania, whether by means of careful cultivation or by accident, has lately excited consideration by some new names - boasting the trebellian vintage four miles from naples, the cauline close to capua, and the trebulan when grown in the district of the same name (though otherwise it is always classed as a common wine), and the trifoline. as for the wines of pompei, their topmost improvement is a matter of ten years, and they gain nothing from age; also they are detected as unwholesome because of a headache which lasts till noon on the following day. these instances, if i am not mistaken, go to show that it is the country and the soil that matter, not the grape, and that it is superfluous to go on with a long enumeration of kinds, since the same vine has a different value in different places. in the spanish provinces the vineyards of lacetanum are famous for the quantity of wine they produce, while for choice quality the vineyards of tarragon and lauron and those of the balearics among the islands challenge comparison with the first vintages of italy. and i am not unaware that most people will think that many have been passed over, inasmuch as everybody has his own favourite, and wherever one may go one finds the same story current - how that one of the freedmen of his late majesty augustus, who was the most skilful among them for his judgement and palate, in tasting wine for the emperor's table passed this remark to the master of the house where augustus was visiting in regard to a wine of the district: 'the flavour of this wine is new to me, and it is not of a high class, but all the same i prophesy that the emperor will not drink any other.' i would not deny that other wines also deserve a high reputation, but the ones that i have enumerated are those on which the general agreement of the ages will be found to have pronounced judgement.
