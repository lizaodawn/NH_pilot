the sixth region of italy: adjoining to this is the sixth region, which includes umbria and the gallic territory in the vicinity of ariminum. at ancona begins the coast of that part of gaul known as gallia togata. the siculi and the liburni possessed the greater part of this district, and more particularly the territories of palma, of praetutia, and of adria. these were expelled by the umbri, these again by the etrurians, and these in their turn by the gauls. the umbri are thought to have been the most ancient race in italy, it being supposed that they were called "ombrii" by the greeks, from the fact of their having survived the rains which had inundated the earth. we read that 300 of their towns were conquered by the tusci; at the present day we find on their coast the river aesis, senogallia, the river metaurus, the colonies of fanum fortunae and pisaurum, with a river of the same name; and, in the interior, those of hispellum and tuder.
