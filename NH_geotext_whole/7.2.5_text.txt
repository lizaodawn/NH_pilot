there are a few families in the faliscan territory, not far from the city of rome, named the hirpi, which at the yearly sacrifice to apollo performed on mount soracte walk over a charred pile of logs without being scorched, and who consequently enjoy exemption under a perpetual decree of the senate from military service and all other burdens. some people are born with parts of the body possessing special remarkable properties, for instance king pyrrhus in the great toe of his right foot, to touch which was a cure for inflammation of the spleen; it is recorded that at his cremation it proved impossible to burn the toe with the rest of the body, and it was stored in a chest in a temple.
