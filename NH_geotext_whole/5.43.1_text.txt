bithynia: and now as to the remaining places on this coast. on the road from cius into the interior is prusa, in bithynia, founded by hannibal at the foot of olympus, at a distance of twenty-five miles from nicaea, lake ascanius lying between them. we then come to nicaea, formerly called olbia, and situate at the bottom of the ascanian gulf; as also a second place called prusa, at the foot of mount hypius. pythopolis, parthenopolis, and coryphanta are no longer in existence. along the coast we find the rivers aesius, bryazon, plataneus, areus, aesyros, geodos, also called chrysorroas, and the promontory upon which once stood the town of megarice. the gulf that here runs inland received the name of craspedites from the circumstance of that town lying, as it were, upon its skirt. astacum, also, formerly stood here, from which the same gulf has received the name of the 'astacenian': the town of libyssa formerly stood at the spot where we now see nothing but the tomb of hannibal. at the bottom of the gulf lies nicomedia, a famous city of bithynia; then comes the promontory of leucatas, by which the astacenian gulf is bounded, and thirty-seven miles distant from nicomedia; and then, the land again approaching the other side, the straits which extend as far as the thracian bosporus. upon these are situate chalcedon, a free town, sixty-two miles from nicomedia, formerly called procerastis, then colpusa, and after that the "city of the blind," from the circumstance that its founders did not know where to build their city, byzantium being only seven stadia distant, a site which is preferable in every respect.
