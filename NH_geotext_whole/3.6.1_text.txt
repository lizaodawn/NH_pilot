of italy: next comes italy, and we begin with the ligures, after whom we have etruria, umbria, latium, where the mouths of the tiber are situate, and rome, the capital of the world, sixteen miles distant from the sea. we then come to the coasts of the volsci and of campania, and the districts of picenum, of lucania, and of bruttium, where italy extends the farthest in a southerly direction, and projects into the [two] seas with the chain of the alps, which there forms pretty nearly the shape of a crescent. leaving bruttium we come to the coast of graecia, then the salentini, the pediculi, the apuli, the peligni, the frentani, the marrucini, the vestini, the sabini, the picentes, the galli, the umbri, the tusci, the veneti, the carni, the iapydes, the histri, and the liburni.
