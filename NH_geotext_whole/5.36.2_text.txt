the most noted island, however, in this gulf is that of cos, fifteen miles distant from halicarnassus, and 100 in circumference, according to the opinion of many writers. it was formerly called merope; according to staphylus, cea; meropis, as dionysius tells us; and, after that, nymphaea. in this island there is mount prion. nisyros, formerly called porphyris, is supposed to have been severed from the island of cos. we next come to the island of caryanda, with a city of that name, and that of pidosus, not far from halicarnassus. in the ceramicus gulf we also find priaponnesos, hipponnesos, psyra, mya, lampsa, aemyndus, passala, crusa, pinnicussa, sepiussa, and melano. at a short distance from the mainland is an island which bears the name of cinaedopolis, from the circumstance that king alexander left behind there certain persons of a most disgraceful character.
