to the same family also belongs bryon, obtained from the catkins of the white poplar. the best kind grows in the neighbourhood of cnidus or caria, in waterless districts or on dry rough ground, and a second best quality grows on the cedar in lycia. to the same group also belongs oenanthe, obtained from the cluster of the wild vine. it is picked when it flowers, which is the time when it has the best scent, and it is dried in the shade on a linen sheet spread out for the purpose, and then put into casks to store. the best kind comes from parapotamia, the second best from antiochia and laodicea in syria, and the third best from the mountains in media; the last kind is more useful for medicines. some people prefer the kind that grows in the island of cyprus to all of these. as for the oenanthe produced in africa it is only used by the doctors, and is called massaris. but all the oenanthe obtained from the white wild vine is superior to that from the black.
