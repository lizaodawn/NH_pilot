let us also repay due gratitude to the ravens the gratitude that is their due, evidenced also by the indignation and not only by the knowledge of the roman nation. when tiberius was emperor, a young raven from a brood hatched on the top of the temple of castor and pollux flew down to a cobbler's shop in the vicinity, being also commended to the master of the establishment by religion. it soon picked up the habit of talking, and every morning used to fly off to the rostra that faces the forum and salute tiberius and then germanicus and drusus caesar by name, and next the roman public passing by, afterwards returning to the shop; and it became remarkable by several years' constant performance of this function. this bird the tenant of the next cobbler's shop killed, whether because of his neighbour's competition or in a sudden outburst of anger, as he tried to make out, because some dirt had fallen on his stock of shoes from its droppings; this caused such a disturbance among the public that the man was first driven, out of the district and later actually made away with, and the bird's funeral was celebrated with a vast crowd of followers, the draped bier being carried on the shoulders of two ethiopians and in front of it going in procession a flute-player and all kinds of wreaths right to the pyre, which had been erected on the right hand side of the appian road at the second milestone on the ground called rediculus's plain. so adequate a justification did the roman nation consider a bird's cleverness to be for a funeral procession and for the punishment of a roman citizen, in the city in which many leading men had had no obsequies at all, while the death of scipio aemilianus after he had destroyed carthage and numantia not been avenged by a single person. the date of this was 28 march, ad 36, in the consulship of marcus servilius and gaius cestius. at the present day also there was in the city of rome at the time when i was publishing this book a crow belonging to a knight of rome, that came from southern spain, and was remarkable in the first place for its very black colour and then for uttering sentences of several words and frequently learning still more words in addition. also there was recently a report of one crates surnamed monoceros in the district of eriza in asia hunting with the aid of ravens, to such an extent that he used to carry them down into the forests perched on the crest's of his helmet and on his shoulders; the birds used to track out and drive the game, the practice being carried to such a point that even wild ravens followed him in this way when he left the forest. certain persons have thought it worth recording that a raven was seen during a drought dropping stones into a monumental urn in which some rain water still remained but so that the bird was unable to reach it; in this way as it was afraid to go down into the urn, the bird by piling up stones in the manner described raised the water high enough to supply itself with a drink.
