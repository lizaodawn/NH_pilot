aetolia: the peoples of aitolia are the athamanes, the tymphaei, the ephyri, the aenienses, the perrhaebi, the dolopes, the maraces, and the atraces, in whose territory rises the river atrax, which flows into the ionian sea. calydon is a city of aitolia, situate at a distance of seven miles from the sea, and near the banks of the river evenus. we then come to macynia, and molycria, behind which lie mounts chalcis and taphiassus. on the coast again, there is the promontory of antirrhium, off which is the mouth of the corinthian gulf, which flows in and separates aitolia from the peloponnesus, being less than one mile in width. the promontory which faces it on the opposite side is called rhion. the towns of aitolia, however, on the corinthian gulf are naupactus and pylene; and, more inland, pleuron and halicyrna. the most famous mountains are tomarus, in the district of dodona, crania in ambracia, aracynthus in acarnania, and acanthon, panaetolium, and macynium, in aitolia.
