on the other hand some other marvels are deadly. ctesias writes that in armenia is a spring in which are dark fish that, eaten as food, bring instant death, as i have heard do the fish also from the water around the rising of the danube, until a spring is reached close to the main channel, where the fish of this sort go no further. at this point, therefore, report says is the real source of that river. they tell us that this same phenomenon occurs in lydia in the marsh of the nymphs. in arcadia near the pheneus there flows from the rocks a stream called styx, which i have said proves instantly fatal to life, but theophrastus tells us that in it are small fish equally deadly; no other kind of poisonous spring is like this. theopompus also says that near cychri in thrace are deadly waters, lycos that at leontini is water that kills on the third day after drinking, and varro that on soracte is poisonous water in a spring four feet wide. at sunrise, he adds, this bubbles out as though it boiled, and birds that have tasted it lie dead close by. for certain waters have also this insidious property, that the very prospect is attractive; as at nonacris in arcadia, which has nothing at all about it to serve as a warning. they think that this water harms by its excessive cold, seeing that as it flows it itself turns to stone. it is otherwise around tempe in thessaly, for its poison is a terror to everyone, and they tell us that by the water there even bronze and iron are corroded. it flows, as i have pointed out, for only a short distance, and a marvellous thing is related of this spring: it is embraced by the roots of a wild carob always bearing purple blossom. and a unique kind of herb flourishes on the margins of the spring. in macedonia, not far from the tomb of the poet euripides, two streams join, one very wholesome to drink, the other a deadly poison.
