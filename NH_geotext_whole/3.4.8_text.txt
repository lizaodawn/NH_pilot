to the jurisdiction of clunia the varduli contribute fourteen nations, of whom we need only particularize the albanenses, the turmodigi, consisting of four tribes, among which are the segisamonenses and the segisamaiulienses. to the same jurisdiction belong the carietes and the vennenses with five states, among which are the velienses. thither too resort the pelendones of the celtiberians, in four different nations, among whom the numantini were especially famous. also, among the eighteen states of the vaccaei, there are the intercatienses, the pallantini, the lacobrigenses, and the caucenses. but among the seven peoples belonging to the cantabri, juliobriga is the only place worthy of mention; and of the ten states of the autrigones, tritium and virovesca. the river areva gives its name to the arevaci; of whom there are six towns, segontia and uxama, names which are frequently given to other places, as also segovia and nova augusta, termes, and clunia itself, the frontier of celtiberia. the remaining portion turns off towards the ocean, being occupied by the varduli, already mentioned, and the cantabri.
