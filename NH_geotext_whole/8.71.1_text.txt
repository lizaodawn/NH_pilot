in egypt an ox is even worshipped in place of a god; its name is apis. its distinguishing mark is a bright white spot in the shape of a crescent on the right flank, and it has a knob under the tongue which they call a beetle. it is not lawful for it to exceed a certain number of years of life, and they kill it by drowning it in the fountain of the priests, proceeding with lamentation to look for another to put in its place, and they go on mourning till they have found one, actually shaving the hair off their heads. nevertheless the search never continues long. when the successor is found it is led by 100 priests to memphis. it has a pair of shrines, which they call its bedchambers, that supply the nations with auguries: when it enters one this is a joyful sign, but in the other one it portends terrible events. it gives answers to private individuals by taking food out of the hand of those who consult it; it turned away from the hand of germanicus caesar, who was made away with not long after. usually living in retirement, when it sallies forth into assemblies it proceeds with lictors to clear the way, and companies of boys escort it singing a song in its honour; it seems to understand, and to desire to be worshipped. these companies are suddenly seized with frenzy and chant prophecies of future events. once a year a cow is displayed to it, she too with her decorations, although they are not the same as his; and it is traditional for her always to be found and put to death on the same day. at memphis there is a place in the nile which from its shape they call the goblet; every year they throw into the river there a gold and a silver cup on the days which they keep as the birthdays of apis. these are seven; and it is a remarkable fact that during these days nobody is attacked by crocodiles, but that after midday on the eighth day the creature's savagery returns.
