before valgius the only roman who had written on this subject, as far as i can discover, was pompeius lenaeus, a freedman of pompeius magnus, in whose day, i find, scientific treatment of it first found a home among roman students. for it was mithridates, the greatest king of his time, whom pompeius vanquished, that was, we know by evidence as well as by report, a more attentive investigator of life's problems than any of those born before him. by his unaided efforts he thought out the plan of drinking poison daily, after first taking remedies, in order that sheer custom might render it harmless; he was the first to discover the various antidotes, one of which is even known by his name; he also discovered the mixing with antidotes of the blood of pontic ducks, because they lived on poison; addressed to him were treatises, still extant, written by the famous physician asclepiades, who when urgently invited to come from rome sent instructions instead; mithridates alone of men is definitely known to have spoken twenty-two languages, and no man of his subject peoples was ever addressed by him through an interpreter during all the fifty-six years of his reign. he then, with his brilliant intellect and wide interests, was an especially diligent student of medicine, and collected detailed knowledge from all his subjects, who comprised a great part of the world, leaving among his private possessions a bookcase of these treatises with specimens and the properties of each. pompeius however on getting possession of all the royal booty ordered his freedman lenaeus, a man of letters, to translate these into latin. this great victory therefore was as beneficent to life as it was to the state.
