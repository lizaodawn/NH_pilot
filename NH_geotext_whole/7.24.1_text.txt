as to memory, the boon most necessary for life, it is not easy to say who most excelled in it, so morning. many men having gained renown for it. king cyrus could give their names to all the soldiers in his army, lucius scipio knew the names of the whole roman people, king pyrrhus's envoy cineas knew those of the senate and knighthood at rome the day after his arrival. mithridates who was king of twenty-two races gave judgements in as many languages, in an assembly addressing each race in turn without an interpreter. a person in greece named charmadas recited the contents of any volumes in libraries that anyone asked him to quote, just as if he were reading them. finally, a memoria technica was constructed, which was invented by the lyric poet simonides and perfected by metrodorus of scepsis, enabling anything heard to be repeated in the identical words. also no other human faculty is equally fragile: injuries from, and even apprehensions of, diseases and accident may affect in some cases a single field of memory and in others the whole. a man has been known when struck by a stone to forget how to read and write but nothing else. one who fell from a very high roof forgot his mother and his relatives and friends, another when ill forgot his servants also; the orator messala corvinus forgot his own name. similarly tentative and hesitating lapses of memory often occur when the body even when uninjured is in repose; also the gradual approach of sleep curtails the memory and makes the unoccupied mind wonder where it is.
