lake maeotis and the adjoining nations: after passing cimmerium, the coast is inhabited by the maeotici, the vali, the serbi, the arrechi, the zingi, and the psessi. we then come to the river tanais, which discharges itself into the sea by two mouths, and the banks of which are inhabited by the sarmatae, the descendants of the medi, it is said, a people divided into numerous tribes. the first of these are the sauromatae gynaecocratumeni, the husbands of the amazons. next to them are the aevazae, the coitae, the cicimeni, the messeniani, the costobocci, the choatrae, the zigae, the dandarii, the thyssagetae, and the iyrcae, as far as certain rugged deserts and densely wooded vallies, beyond which again are the arimphaei, who extend as far as the riphaean mountains. the scythians call the river tanais by the name of silis, and the maeotis the temarunda, meaning the "mother of the sea." there is a city also at the mouth of the tanais. the neighbouring country was inhabited first by the carians, then by the clazomenii and maeones, and after them by the panticapenses.
