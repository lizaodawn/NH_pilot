the spionia, called by some the thorn-vine, is able to bear heat, and is ripened by rainy weather in autumn; what is more, indeed, it is the only vine that thrives from fog, on which account it is specially grown in the district of ravenna. the venicula is one of the best vines that shed their flowers, and its grapes are particularly well suited for preserving in jars; the people of campania prefer to call it by the name of surcula, and others by that of scapula, while the name for it at tarracina is numisiana; it has no strength of its own but is entirely conditioned by the strength of the soil; all the same, as far south as vesuvius it is very potent if kept in earthenware jars from sorrento. for at vesuvius there is murgentina, a very strong vine imported from sicily, called by some pompeiana, which only bears well in a rich soil, just as the horconia vine only flourishes in campania. the opposite is the case with the arceraca, called in virgil argitis, which has the property of imparting extra richness to the soil, while itself offering a very stout resistance to rain and to old age, though it will hardly produce wine every year, and its grapes are only valued for eating, but it bears exceptionally large crops. the mettica vine also stands the years, and faces all weather very strongly; it bears a black grape, and its wines acquire a reddish colour in old age.
