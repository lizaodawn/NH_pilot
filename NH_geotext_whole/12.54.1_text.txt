but every other scent ranks below balsam. the only country to which this plant has been vouchsafed is judea. where formerly it grew in only two gardens, both belonging to the king; one of them was of not more than twenty biugera in extent and the other less. this variety of shrub was exhibited to the capital by the emperors vespasian and titus; and it is a remarkable fact that ever since the time of pompey the great even trees have figured among the captives in our triumphal processions. the balsam-tree is now a subject of rome, and pays tribute together with the race to which it belongs; it differs entirely in character from the accounts that had been given of it by roman and foreign writers, being more like a vine than a myrtle: it has quite recently been taught to grow from mallet-shoots tied up on trellises like a vine, and it covers whole hillsides as vineyards do. a balsam unsupported by a trellis and carrying its own weight is pruned in a similar manner when it puts oat shoots; the use of the rake makes it thrive and sprout rapidly, bearing in its third year. its leaf is very near that of the tuber-apple, and it is an evergreen. the jews vented their wrath upon this plant as they also did upon their own lives, but the romans protected it against them, and there have been pitched battles in defence of a shrub. it is now cultivated by the treasury authorities, and was never before more plentiful; but its height has not advanced beyond three feet.
