but i am inclined to believe that the things mentioned were made of the wood of the wild vine. our own vines are kept down by yearly pruning, and all their strength is drawn out into shoots, or else thrown downward into layers, and the only benefit these supply is that of their juice, obtained by means of a variety of methods adapted to the peculiarities of the climate and the qualities of the soil. in campania the vines espouse the poplars, and embracing their brides and climbing with wanton arms in a series of knots among their branches, rise level with their tops, soaring aloft to such a height that a hired vintager expressly stipulates in his contract for the cost of a funeral and a grave! in fact they never stop growing; and i have before now seen entire country houses and mansions encircled by the shoots and clinging tendrils of a single vine. and a thing that was considered in the first degree worthy of record also by valerianus cornelius is that a single vine in the colonnades of livia at rome protects the open walks with its shady trellises, while at the same time it produces 12 amphorae of juice yearly.
