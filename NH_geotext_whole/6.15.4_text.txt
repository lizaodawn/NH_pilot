in this place it may be as well to correct an error into which many persons have fallen, and even those who lately took part with corbulo in the armenian war. the gates of iberia, which we have mentioned as the caucasian, they have spoken of as being called the 'caspian,' and the coloured plans which have been sent from those parts to rome have that name written upon them. the menaced expedition, too, that was contemplated by the emperor nero, was said to be designed to extend as far as the caspian gates, whereas it was really intended for those which lead through iberia into the territory of the sarmatae; there being hardly any possibility of approach to the caspian sea, by reason of the close juxtaposition of the mountains there. there are, however, other caspian gates, which join up to the caspian tribes; but these can only be distinguished from a perusal of the narrative of those who took part in the expedition of alexander the great.
