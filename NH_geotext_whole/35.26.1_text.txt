among the remaining colours which because of their high cost, as we said, are supplied by patrons, dark purple holds the first place. it is produced by dipping silversmiths' earth along with purple cloth and in like manner, the earth absorbing the colour more quickly than the wool. the best is that which being the first formed in the boiling cauldron becomes saturated with the dyes in their primary state, and the next best produced when white earth is added to the same liquor after the first has been removed; and every time this is done the quality deteriorates, the liquid becoming more diluted at each stage. the reason why the dark purple of pozzuoli is more highly praised than that of tyre or gaetulia or laconia, places which produce the most costly purples, is that it combines most easily with hysginum and madder which cannot help absorbing it. the cheapest comes from canusium. the price is from one to thirty denarii per lb. painters using it put a coat of sandyx underneath and then add a coat of dark purple mixed with egg, and so produce the brilliance of cinnabar; if they wish instead to produce the glow of purple, they lay a coat of blue underneath, and then cover this with dark purple mixed with egg.
