achaia: the province called achaia begins at the isthmus; from the circumstance of its cities being ranged in regular succession on its coast, it formerly had the name of aegialos. the first place there is lecheae, already mentioned, a port of the corinthians; next to which is olyros, a fortress of the people of pellene; then the former towns of helice and bura, and the places in which their inhabitants took refuge after their towns had been swallowed up by the sea, sikyon namely, aegira, aegium, and erineos. in the interior are kleonai and hysiae; then come the port of panormus, and rhium already mentioned; from which promontory, patrae, of which we have previously spoken, is distant five miles; and then the place where pherae stood. of the nine mountains of achaia, scioessa is the most famous; there is also the fountain of cymothoe. beyond patrae we find the town of olenum, the colony of dyme, the places where buprasium and hyrmine once stood, the promontory of araxus, the bay of cyllene, and the promontory of chelonates, at five miles' distance from cyllene. there is also the fortress of phlious [pheia?]; the district around which was called by homer araethyrea, and, after his time, asopis.
