another class of portent is when trees grow in the wrong places, as on the heads of statues or on altars, and when different kinds of trees grow on trees themselves. at cyzicus before the siege a fig-tree grew on a laurel; and similarly at tralles about the time of caesar's civil wars a palm grew up on the pedestal of the dictator's statue. moreover at rome during the war with perseus a palm-tree grew up on the altar of jove on the capitol, portending victory and triumphal processions; and after this tree had been brought down by storms, a fig-tree sprang up in the same place, this occurring during the censorship of marcus messala and gaius cassius, a period which according to so weighty an authority as piso dates the overthrow of the sense of honour. a portent that will eclipse all those ever heard of occurred in our own day in the territory of the marrucini, at the fall of the emperor nero: an olive grove belonging to a leading member of the equestrian order named vettius marcellus bodily crossed the public highway, and the crops growing on the other side passed over in the opposite direction to take the place of the olive grove.
