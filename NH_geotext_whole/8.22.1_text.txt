these stories give credibility to democritus also, who tells a tale of thoas in arcadia being saved by a snake. when a boy he had fed it and made a great pet of it, and his parent being afraid of the snake's nature and size had taken it away into an uninhabited region, where it recognized thoas's voice and came to his rescue when he was entrapped by an ambush of brigands. for as to the reports about infants when they had been exposed being fed by the milk of wild animals, as well as those about our founders being nursed by a she-wolf, i deem it more reasonable for them to be credited to the grandeur of their destinies than to the nature of the wild animals.
