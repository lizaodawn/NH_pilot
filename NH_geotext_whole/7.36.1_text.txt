of filial affection there have it is true been unlimited instances all over the world, but one at rome with which the whole of the rest could not compare. a plebeian woman of low position and therefore unknown, who had just given birth to a child, had permission to visit her mother who had been shut up in prison as a punishment, and was always searched in advance by the doorkeeper to prevent her carrying in any food; she was detected giving her mother sustenance from her own breasts. in consequence of this marvel the daughter's pious affection was rewarded by the mother's release and both were awarded maintenance for life; and the place where it occurred was consecrated to the goddess concerned, a temple dedicated to filial affection being built on the site of the prison, where the theatre of marcellus now stands, in the consulship of gaius quinctius and manius acilius. in the house of the father of the gracchi two snakes were caught, and in reply to enquiry an oracle declared that he himself would live if the snake of the other sex were killed; "no," said he, "kill my snake: cornelia is young and still able to bear children." this meant, to spare his wife and think of the public interest; and the result prophesied soon followed. marcus lepidus after divorcing his wife appuleia died for love of her. publius rutilius when suffering from a slight illness received news of his brother's defeat in his candidature for the consulship, and at once expired. publius catienus philotimus loved his patron so dearly that he threw himself upon his funeral pyre, although left heir to the whole of his property.
