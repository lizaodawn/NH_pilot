they next came to the promontory of carmania, from which the distance across to the opposite coast, where the macae, a nation of arabia, dwell, is fifty miles; and then to three islands, of which that of oracla is alone inhabited, being the only one supplied with fresh water; it is distant from the mainland twenty-five miles; quite in the gulf, and facing persia, there are four other islands. about these islands sea-serpents were seen swimming towards them, twenty cubits in length, which struck the fleet with great alarm. they then came to the island of athothradus, and those called the gauratae, upon which dwells the nation of the gyani; the river hyperis, which discharges itself midway into the persian gulf, and is navigable for merchant ships; the river sitiogagus, from which to pasargadae is seven days' sail; a navigable river known as the phristimus, and an island without a name; and then the river granis, navigable for vessels of small burden, and flowing through susiane; the deximontani, a people who manufacture bitumen, dwell on its right bank. the river zarotis comes next, difficult of entrance at its mouth, except by those who are well acquainted with it; and then two small islands; after which the fleet sailed through shallows which looked very much like a marsh, but were rendered navigable by certain channels which had been cut there. they then arrived at the mouth of the euphrates, and from thence passed into a lake which is formed by the rivers eulaeus and tigris, in the vicinity of charax, after which they arrived at susa, on the river tigris. here, after a voyage of three months, they found alexander celebrating a festival, seven months after he had left them at patale. such was the voyage performed by the fleet of alexander.
