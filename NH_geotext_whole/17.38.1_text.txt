among the maladies of trees it is in place to speak also of prodigies. we find that figs have grown underneath the leaves of the tree, a vine and a pomegranate have borne fruit on their trunk, not on a shoot or a branch, a vine has borne grapes without having any leaves, and also olives have lost their leaves while the fruit remained on the tree. there are also marvels connected with accident: an olive has come to life again after being completely burnt up, also fig-trees in boeotia gnawed down by locusts have budded afresh. trees also change their colour and turn from black to white, not always with portentous meaning, but chiefly those that grow from seed; and the white poplar turns into a black poplar. some people also think that the service-tree goes barren if transplanted to warmer localities. but it is a portent when sour fruits grow on sweet fruit-trees and sweet on sour, and figs on a wild fig-tree or the contrary, and it is a serious manifestation when trees turn into other trees of an inferior kind, from an olive into a wild olive or from a white grape or green fig into a black grape or a black fig, or as when a plane-tree at laodicea changed into an olive on the arrival of xerxes. not to launch out into an absolutely boundless subject, the volume by aristander teems with portents of this nature in greece, as do the notes of gaius epidius in our own country, including cases of trees that talked. an alarming portent occurred a little before the civil wars of pompey the great, when a tree in the territory of cumae sank into the ground leaving a few branches projecting; and a statement was found in the sibylline books that this portended a slaughter of human beings, and that the nearer to the city the portent had occurred the greater the slaughter would be.
