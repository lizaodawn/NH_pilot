chaplets are also made from the leaves of the flower of jupiter, sweet marjoram, day-lily, southernwood, helenium, water-mint, wild thyme, all with woody stalks like those of the rose. the flower of jupiter is pleasing only for its colour, as it has no scent; it is the same with the flower called in greek phlox. both the stalks however and the leaves of the plants just mentioned are fragrant, except those of wild thyme. helenium is said to have sprung up from the tears of helen, and therefore is very popular in the island of helene. it is a shrub spreading over the ground with its nine-inch sprigs, the leaf being like wild thyme.
