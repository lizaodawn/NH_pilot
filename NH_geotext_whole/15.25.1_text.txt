we give the name of nut to the chestnut, also, although it seems to fit better into the acorn class. the chestnut has its armed rampart in its bristling shell, which in the acorn is only partly developed, and it is surprising that what nature has taken such pains to conceal should be the least valuable of things. some chestnuts produce three nuts from one shell; and the skin is tough, but next to the body of the nut there is a membrane which both in the chestnut and the walnut spoils the taste if it is not peeled off. it is more agreeable as a food when roasted, provided it is ground up, and it supplies a sort of imitation bread for women when they are keeping a fast. they came first from sardis, and consequently they are called nuts of sardis among the greeks, for the name of zeus's nut was given them later, after they had been improved by cultivation. there are now several varieties of them. the taranto chestnut is light and digestible to eat; it has a flat shape. the chestnut called the acorn-chestnut is rounder; it is very easy to peel, and jumps out of the shell quite clean of its own accord. the salarian chestnut also has a flat shape, but that of taranto is less easy to handle. the corellian is more highly spoken of, and so is the variety produced from it by the method which we shall speak of in dealing with grafting, the etereian, which its red skin renders more popular than the three-cornered chestnut and the common black ones called cooking chestnuts. the most highly commended chestnuts come from taranto, and in campania from naples; all the other kinds are grown for pig-food; the pigs carefully chew up the shells as well, together with the kernels.
