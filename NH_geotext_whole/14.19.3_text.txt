there are also wines, made from fruit, which we will specify, adding only the indispensable explanations: first the wine made from date-palms, which is used by the parthians and indians and by the whole of the east, a peck of the rather soft dates called in greek 'common dates' being soaked in two and a quarter gallons of water and then pressed. also fig syrup is made from figs by a similar process, other names for it being pharnuprium and trochis; or if it is not wanted to be sweet, instead of water is added the same quantity of grape-skin juice. also excellent vinegar is made from the cyprus fig, and an even better quality as well from that of alexandria. wine is also made from the syrian carob, and from pears and all kinds of apples (one from pomegranates is called rhoites) as also from cornels, medlars, service berries, dried mulberries and fir-cones; the last are soaked in must before being pressed, but the juice of the preceding fruits is sweet of itself. we will indicate a little later instructions given by cato as to how to make myrtle-syrup. the greeks also employ another method: they boil tender sprigs of myrtle with the leaves on in salted must, and after pounding them boil down one pound of the mixture in 2 1/4 gallons of must until only 1 1/2 gallons are left. the beverage made by the same process from the berries of the wild myrtle is called myrtle wine; this stains the hands.
