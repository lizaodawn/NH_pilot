melinum also is a white colour, the best occurring in the island of melos. it is found in samos also, but the samian is not used by painters, because it is excessively greasy. it is dug up in samos by people lying on the ground and searching for a vein among the rocks. it has the same use in medicine as earth of eretria; it also dries the tongue by contact, and acts as a depilatory, with a cleansing effect. it costs a sesterce a pound.
