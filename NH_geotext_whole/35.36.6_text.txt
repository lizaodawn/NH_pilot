a work of eupompus is a winner in a gymnastic contest holding a palm branch. eupompus's own influence was so powerful that he made a fresh division of painting; it had previously been divided into two schools, called the helladic or grecian and the asiatic, but because of eupompus, who was a sikyonian, the grecian school was subdivided into three groups, the ionic, sikyonian and attic. to pamphilus belong family group, and a battle at phlious and a victory of the athenians, and also odysseus on his raft. he was himself a macedonian by birth, but was brought up at sikyon, and was the first painter highly educated in all branches of learning, especially arithmetic and geometry, without the aid of which he maintained art could not attain perfection. he took no pupils at a lower fee than a talent, at the rate of 500 drachmae per annum, and this was paid him by both apelles and melanthius. it was brought about by his influence, first at sikyon and then in the whole of greece as well, that children of free birth were given lessons in drawing on boxwood, which had not been included hitherto, and that this art was accepted into the front rank of the liberal sciences. and it has always consistently had the honour of being practised by people of free birth, and later on by persons of station, it having always been forbidden that slaves should be instructed in it. hence it is that neither in painting nor in the art of statuary a are there any famous works that were executed by any person who was a slave.
