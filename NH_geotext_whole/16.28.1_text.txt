but a timber rated in the first rank is that of the box, which is rarely marked with wrinkles and only at the root, the rest of it being smooth; box-wood is esteemed for a certain toughness and hardness and for its pale colour, while the tree itself is valued in ornamental gardening. there are three kinds: the gallic box, which is trained to shoot up into conical pillars and attains a rather large height; the oleaster, which is condemned for all purposes, and which gives out an unpleasant smell; and a third kind called our native box, a cultivated variety as i believe of the wild box, which spreads more than the others and forms a thick hedge; it is an evergreen, and will stand clipping. the box abounds in the pyrenees and the kidros mountains and in the berecyntus district, and it grows thickest in corsica, where it bears an objectionable blossom, which causes the bitter taste in corsican honey; its seed arouses the aversion of all living creatures. the box on mount olympus in macedonia makes as thick a growth as the corsican, but it is of a low height. box loves cold and rugged places; also in a fire it is as hard as iron, and is of no use for fuel or charcoal.
