at cyzicus too there survives a temple; and here a small gold tube was inserted into every vertical joint of the dressed stonework by the architect, who was to place within the shrine an ivory statue of jupiter with a marble apollo crowning him. consequently very fine filaments of light shine through the interstices and a gentle refreshing breeze plays on the statues. apart from the ingenuity of the architect, the very material of his device, hidden though it may be, is appreciated as enhancing the value of the whole work.
