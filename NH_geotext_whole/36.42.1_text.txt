we must not forget to discuss also the pumice. characteristics of pumice. this name, of course, is given to the hollowed rocks in the buildings called by the greeks homes of the muses, where such rocks hang from the ceilings so as to create an artificial imitation of a cave. but as for the pumice which is used as a depilatory for women, and nowadays also for men, and moreover, as catullus reminds us, for books, the finest quality occurs in melos, nisyros, and the aeolian islands. the test of its quality is that it should be white, very light in weight, extremely porous and dry, and easy to grind, without being sandy when rubbed. in pharmacy it has a reducing and drying effect. it is calcined three times in a fire of pure charcoal and quenched the same number of times in white wine. it is then washed like cadmea, and having been dried is stored in a place as free from damp as possible. the powder is used mostly for eye-salves, since it gently cleanses ophthalmic ulcers and heals them, and removes the scars. incidentally, some pharmacists, after calcining the pumice three times, prefer to let it cool rather than quench it, and then to pound it mixed with wine. it is added also to poultices, and is then most useful for treating sores on the head or the private parts. tooth powders, too, are prepared from it. theophrastus assures us that topers competing in drinking contests first take a dose of the powder, but states that they run a grave risk unless they fill themselves with wine at a single draught. he adds that the cooling properties of pumice are so powerful that new wine stops bubbling when pumice is added to it.
