i shall not allow these two birds of a feather, two gaiuses or two neros as you please, to enjoy unchallenged even renown such as this; and so i shall show that even their madness was outdone by the resources of a private individual, marcus scaurus, whose aedileship may perhaps have done more than anything to undermine morality, and whose powerful ascendancy may have been a more mischievous achievement on the part of his stepfather sulla than the killing by proscription of so many thousands of people. as aedile he constructed the greatest of all the works ever made by man, a work that surpassed not merely those erected for a limited period but even those intended to last for ever. this was his theatre, which had a stage arranged in three storeys with 360 columns; and this, if you please, in a community that had not tolerated the presence of six columns of hymettus marble without reviling a leading citizen. the lowest storey of the stage was of marble, and the middle one of glass (an extravagance unparalleled even in later times), while the top storey was made of gilded planks. the columns of the lowest storey were, as i have stated, each 38 feet high. the bronze statues in the spaces between the columns numbered 3000, as i mentioned earlier. as for the auditorium, it accommodated 80,000; and yet that of pompey's theatre amply meets all requirements with seats for 40,000 even though the city is so many times larger and the population so much more numerous than it was at that time. the rest of the equipment, with dresses of cloth of gold, scene paintings and other properties was on so lavish a scale that when the surplus knick-knacks that could be put to ordinary use were taken to scaurus' villa at tusculum and the villa itself set on fire and burnt down by the indignant servants, the loss was estimated at 30,000,000 sesterces.
