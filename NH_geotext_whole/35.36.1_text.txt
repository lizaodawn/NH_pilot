in the 90th olympiad lived aglaophon, cephisodorus, erillus, and evenor the father and teacher of parrhasius, a very great painter (about parrhasius we shall have to speak when we come to his period). all these are now artists of note, yet not figures over which our discourse should linger in its haste to arrive at the luminaries of the art; first among whom shone out apollodorus of athens, in the 93rd olympiad. apollodorus was the first artist to give realistic presentation of objects, and the first to confer glory as of right upon the paint brush. his are the priest at prayer and ajax struck by lightning, the latter to be seen at pergamum at the present day. there is no painting now on view by any artist before apollodorus that arrests the attention of the eyes.
