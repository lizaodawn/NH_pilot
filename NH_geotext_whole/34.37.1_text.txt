distinguished from smegma is the substance in the same forges called by the greeks diphryx, from its being twice roasted. it comes from three different sources. it is said to be obtained from a mineral pyrites which is heated in furnaces till it is smelted into a red earth. it is also made in cyprus from mud obtained from a certain cavern, which is first dried and then gradually has burning brushwood put round it. a third way of producing it is from the residue that falls to the bottom in copper furnaces; the difference is that the copper itself runs down into crucibles and the slag forms outside the furnace and the flower floats on the top, but the supplies of diphryx remain behind. some people say that certain globules of stone that is being smelted in the furnaces become soldered together and round this the copper gets red hot, but the stone itself is not fused unless it is transferred into other furnaces, and that it is a sort of kernel of the substance, and that what is called diphryx is the residue left from the smelting. its use in medicine is similar to that of the substances already described; to dry up moisture and remove excrescent growths and act as a detergent. it can be tested by the tongue - contact with it ought immediately to have a parching effect and impart a flavour of copper.
