of spain generally. the first land situate upon this gulf is that which is called the farther spain or baetica; next to which, beginning at the frontier town of urgi, is the nearer, or tarraconensian spain, extending as far as the chain of the pyrenees. the farther spain is divided lengthwise into two provinces, lusitania and baetica, the former stretching along the northern side of the latter, and being divided from it by the river ana. the source of this river is in the district of laminium, in the nearer spain. it first spreads out into a number of small lakes, and then again contracts itself into a narrow channel, or entirely disappears under ground, and after frequently disappearing and again coming to light, finally discharges itself into the atlantic ocean. tarraconensian spain lies on one side, contiguous to the pyrenees, running downwards along the sides of that chain, and, stretching across from the iberian sea to the gallic ocean, is separated from baetica and lusitania by mount solorius, the chains of the oretani and the carpetani, and that of the astures.
