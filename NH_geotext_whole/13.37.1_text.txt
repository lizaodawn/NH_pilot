asia also produces the goat-plant or scorpio, a thorn without leaves and with reddish branches, used for medicinal purposes: italy also has the myrica, which is there called the tamarisk, and achaia the wild brya; a remarkable property of the brya is that only the cultivated kind bears fruit; this resembles a gall-nut. in syria and egypt this shrub is abundant, and we give the name of unlucky wood to its timber; yet some of the timbers of greece are unluckier, for greece grows a tree named the ostrys, another form of the name being ostrya, which grows by itself round rocks washed by water; it is like an ash in its bark and branches, and a pear in its leaf, though the leaves are a little longer and thicker and wrinkled with indentations running all across them; the seed resembles barley in colour as well as shape. the wood is hard and solid, and it is said that if it is brought into a house it causes difficulty in childbirth and painful deaths.
