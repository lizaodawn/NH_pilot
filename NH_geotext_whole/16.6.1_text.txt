acorns at this very day constitute the wealth of many races, even when they are enjoying peace. moreover also when there is a scarcity of corn they are dried and ground into flour which is kneaded to make bread; beside this, at the present day also in the spanish provinces a place is found for acorns in the second course at table. acorns have a sweeter flavour when roasted in the ashes. moreover it was provided by law in the twelve tables that it was permissible to gather up acorns falling on to another person's land. there are many kinds of acorns, and they differ in their fruit, habitat, sex and flavour, some having the shape of the beech-nut and others of the mast of the oak and the holm-oak, and there are also differences within each of these varieties. moreover some grow wild in forests and others are more tame, occupying cultivated ground. then they are different in mountain regions and in the plains, as also they differ in sex - male and female, and likewise in flavour: the sweetest of them all is beech-mast, it being recorded by cornelius alexander that the people in the town of chios actually held out against a siege by using it for food. it is not possible to distinguish its kinds by their names, which are different in different places, inasmuch as we see the hard-oak and the common oak growing everywhere, but the winter oak not in every region, and the fourth species of the same class, called the turkey oak, is not known at all even to the greater part of italy. we will therefore distinguish the varieties by their properties and natures, also using the greek names when necessary.
