to hercules too they ascribe the plant which is called apollinaris by some, altercum by us romans, but by the greeks hyoscyamos ('pig's bean'). there are several kinds of it: one has black seed, with flowers that are almost purple, and a thorny calyx, growing in galatia. the common kind, however, is whiter and more bushy; it is taller than the poppy. the seed of the third kind is like the seed of irio; but all kinds cause insanity and giddiness. a fourth kind is soft, downy, richer in juice than the others, with a white seed, and growing in places near the sea. this is a kind that medical men have adopted, as they have that with a red seed. sometimes, however, the white seed turns red if gathered before getting ripe, and then it is rejected; and generally no kind is ever gathered before it has become dry. it has the character of wine, and therefore injures the head and brain. use is made of the seed as it is or when the juice has been extracted from it. the juice is extracted separately also from the stems and leaves. they also use the root, but the drug is, in my opinion, a dangerous medicine in any form. in fact, it is well known that even the leaves affect the brain if more than four are taken in drink; yet the ancients used to take them in wine under the impression that fever was so brought down. an oil is made from the seed, as i have said, which by itself if poured into the ears deranges the brain. it is a wonderful thing that they have prescribed remedies for those who have taken the drink, which implies that it is a poison, and yet have included it among remedies; so unwearied have been researches in making every possible experiment, even to compelling poisons to be helpful remedies.
