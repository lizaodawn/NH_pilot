there is yet another kind of choice liquor, called garum, consisting of the guts of fish and the other parts that would otherwise be considered refuse; these are soaked in salt, so that garum is really liquor from the putrefaction of these matters. once this used to be made from a fish that the greeks called garos; they showed that by fumigation with its burning head the afterbirth was brought away. today the most popular garum is made from the scomber in the fisheries of carthago spartaria - it is called garum of the allies - one thousand sesterces being exchanged for about two congii of the fish. scarcely any other liquid except unguents has come to be more highly valued, bringing fame even to the nations that make it. the scomber is caught also in mauretania and at carteia in baetica; the scomber enters the mediterranean from the atlantic, but it is used only for making garum. clazomenae too is famous for garum, and so are pompeii and leptis, just as antipolis and thurii are for muria, and today too also delmatia.
