again there is another group of plants which are sown at the autumn equinox - coriander, dill, orage, mallow, sorrel, chervil, the greek name for which is lad's love, and mustard, which with its pungent taste and fiery effect is extremely beneficial for the health. it grows entirely wild, though it is improved by being transplanted: but on the other hand when it has once been sown it is scarcely possible to get the place free of it, as the seed when it falls germinates at once. it is also used to make a relish, by being boiled down in saucepans till its sharp flavour ceases to be noticeable; also its leaves are boiled, like those of all other vegetables. there are three kinds of mustard plant, one of a slender shape, another with leaves like those of turnip, and the third with those of rocket. the best seed comes from egypt. the athenian word for mustard is napy, those of other dialects thlaspi and lizard-herb.
