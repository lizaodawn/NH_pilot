without a doubt no effort of ours can compete with the amaranth. yet it is more truly a purple ear than a flower, and is itself without scent. a wonderful thing about it is that it likes to be plucked, growing again more luxuriant than ever. it comes out in august, and lasts into the autumn. the prize goes to the amaranth grown at alexandria, which is gathered for keeping; in a wonderful way, after all flowers are over, the amaranth, if moistened with water, revives and makes winter chaplets. its special characteristic is implied in its name, given to it because it will not wither.
