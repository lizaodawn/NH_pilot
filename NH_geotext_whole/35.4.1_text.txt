after him marcus aemilius, quintus lutatius's colleague in the consulship, set up portrait-shields not only in the basilica aemilia but also in his own home, and in doing this he was following a truly warlike example; for the shields which contained the likenesses resembled those employed in the fighting at troy; and this indeed gave them their name of clupei which is not derived from the word meaning 'to be celebrated,' as the misguided ingenuity of scholars has made out. it is a copious inspiration of valour for there to be a representation on a shield of the countenance of him who once used it. the carthaginians habitually made both shields and statues of gold, and carried these with them: at all events marcius, who took vengeance for the scipios in spain, found a shield of this kind that belonged to hasdrubal, in that general's camp when he captured it, and this shield was hung above the portals of the temple on the capitol till the first fire. indeed it is [83 b.c.] noticed that our ancestors felt so little anxiety about this matter that in the 575th year of the city, when the consuls were lucius maulius and quintus fulvius, the person who contracted for the safety of the capitol, marcus aufidius, informed the senate that the shields which for a good many censorship periods past had been scheduled as made of bronze were really silver.
