but at myra in lycia in the spring of apollo called curium, when summoned three times by the pipe the fishes come to give oracular responses. for the fish to snap at the meat thrown to them is a happy augury for enquirers, to cast it aside with their tails an augury of disaster. at hieropolis in syria the fish in the pond of venus obey the voice of the temple ministers; they come at their call adorned with gold, fawning to be scratched, and offer gaping mouths to receive their hands. at stabiae in campania at the rock of hercules the melanuri in the sea seize the bread thrown to them, but they will not go near any food in which is a hook.
