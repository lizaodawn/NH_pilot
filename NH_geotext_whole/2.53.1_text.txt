the tuscan writers hold the view that there are nine gods who send thunderbolts, and that these are of eleven kinds, because jupiter hurls three varieties. only two of these deities have been retained by the romans, who attribute thunderbolts in the daytime to jupiter and those in the night to summanus, the latter being naturally rare because the sky at night is colder. etruria believes that some also burst out of the ground, which it calls 'low bolts,' and that these are rendered exceptionally direful and accursed by the season of winter, though all the bolts that they believe of earthly origin are not the ordinary ones and do not come from the stars but from the nearer and more disordered element: a clear proof of this being that all those coming from the upper heaven deliver slanting blows, whereas these which they call earthly strike straight. and those that fall from the nearer elements are supposed to come out of the earth because they leave no traces as a result of their rebound, although that is the principle not of a downward blow but of a slanting one. those who pursue these enquiries with more subtlety think that these bolts come from the planet saturn, just as the inflammatory ones come from mars, as, for instance, when bolsena, the richest town in etruria, was entirely burnt up by a thunderbolt. also the first ones that occur after a man sets up house for himself are called 'family meteors,' as foretelling his fortune for the whole of his life. however, people think that private meteors, except those that occur either at a man's first marriage or on his birthday, do not prophecy beyond ten years, nor public ones beyond the 30th year, except those occurring at the colonization of a town.
