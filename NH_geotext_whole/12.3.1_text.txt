but who would not be justifiably surprised to hear that a tree has been procured from another clime merely for the sake of shade? this tree is the plane, which was first imported into the ionian sea as far as the island of san domenico to plant over the tomb of diomede, and which crossed from there to sicily and was one of the first trees bestowed on italy, and which has now travelled as far as belgium and actually occupies soil that pays tribute to rome, so that the tribes have to pay rent even for shade. the elder dionysius, the tyrant of sicily, imported plane-trees to the city of rcggio as a marvel to adorn his palace, on the site where afterwards a gymnasium was built; and it is found in the authorities that these trees were not able to grow to full size, and that in all italy there were no others except the 'spania.'
