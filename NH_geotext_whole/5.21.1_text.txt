syria upon the euphrates. arabia, above mentioned, has the cities of edessa, formerly called antiochia, and, from the name of its fountain, callirhoe, and carrhae, memorable for the defeat of crassus there. adjoining to this is the praefecture of mesopotamia, which derives its origin from the assyrians, and in which are the towns of anthemusia and nicephorium; after which come the arabians, known by the name of praetavi, with singara for their capital. below samosata, on the side of syria, the river marsyas flows into the euphrates. at cingilla ends the territory of commagene, and the state of the immei begins. the cities which are here washed by the river are those of epiphania and antiochia, generally known as epiphania and antiochia on the euphrates; also zeugma, seventy-two miles distant from samosata, famous for the passage there across the euphrates. opposite to it is apamia, which seleucus, the founder of both cities, united by a bridge. the people who join up to mesopotamia are called the rhoali. other towns in syria are those of europus, and what was formerly thapsacus, now amphipolis. we then come to the arabian scenitae. the euphrates then proceeds in its course till it reaches the place called ura, at which, taking a turn to the east, it leaves the syrian deserts of palmyra, which extend as far as the city of petra and the regions of arabia felix.
