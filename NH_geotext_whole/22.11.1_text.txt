some have incorrectly thought that erynge is the same as liquorice, which therefore should come immediately after erynge in my discussion. the plant itself is undoubtedly among the spinous ones, with prickly, fleshy, gummy leaves, bushy, two cubits high, with a flower like the hyacinth, and fruit the size of the little balls of the plane tree. the finest grows in cilicia, the next best in pontus; it has a sweet root, the only part to be used. it is dug up at the setting of the pleiades, and is as long as lycium root, the boxwood-coloured being superior to the dark and the pliant to the brittle. to be used as a suppository it is boiled down to one-third, for other purposes to the consistency of honey, though occasionally it is pounded, in which form it is applied to wounds and for all affections of the throat. merely thickened and then placed under the tongue the juice is good for the voice; it is also good for the chest and liver. i have already stated that this root allays hunger and thirst, for which reason some have named it adipsos (thirst-quencher), and prescribed it for dropsy, in order to prevent thirst. because of this property it is chewed as a mouth medicine, and it is often sprinkled on sores in the mouth and inflammatory swellings of the eyelids. it also cures irritation of the bladder, pains in the kidneys, tumours of the anus, and sores on the genitals. some have prescribed it in a draught for quartan ague, in doses of two drachmae by weight, with pepper, to be taken in a hemina of water. chewed, it checks the flow of blood from a wound. some authorities have asserted that it also expels stone from the bladder.
