in front of these, and lying out at sea, are cephallenia and zacynthus, both of them free, ithaca, dulichium, same, and crocyle. cephallenia, formerly known as melaena, lies at a distance of eleven miles from paxos, and is ninety-three miles in circumference: its city of same has been levelled to the ground by the romans; but it still possesses three others. between this island and achaia lies the island of zacynthus, remarkable for its city of the same name, and for its singular fertility. it formerly had the name of hyrie, and lies to the south of cephallenia, at a distance of twenty-five miles; in it there is the famous mountain of elatus. this island is thirty-six miles in circumference. at a distance of fifteen miles from zacynthus is ithaca, in which is mount neritus; its circumference in all is twenty-five miles. twelve miles distant from this island is araxus, a promontory of the peloponnesus. before ithaca, lying out in the main sea, are asteris and prote; and before zacynthus, at a distance of thirty-five miles in the direction of the south-east wind, are the two strophades, by some known as the plotae. before cephallenia lies letoia, before pylos the three sphagiae, and before messene the oinussae, as many in number.
