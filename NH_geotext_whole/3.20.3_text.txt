of these the best known are the following - flowing from the range of the apennines, the jactus, the tanarus, the trebia which passes placentia, the tarus, the incia, the gabellus, the scultenna, and the rhenus: from the chain of the alps, the stura, the orgus, the two duriae, the sessites, the ticinus, the lambrus, the addua, the ollius, and the mincius. there is no river known to receive a larger increase than this in so short a space; so much so indeed that it is impelled onwards by this vast body of water, and, invading the land, forms deep channels in its course: hence it is that, although a portion of its stream is drawn off by rivers and canals between ravenna and altinum, for a space of 120 miles, still, at the spot where it discharges the vast body of its waters, it is said to form seven seas.
