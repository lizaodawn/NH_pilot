there is great question among the roman augurs about the sanqualis and the immusulus. some think that the immusulus is the chick of the vulture and the sanqualis of the bearded vulture. masurius says that the sanqualis is a bearded vulture and the immusulus an eagle's chick before its tail turns white. some persons have asserted that they have not been seen at rome since the time of the augur mucius, but for my own part i think it more probable that in the general slackness that prevails they have not been recognized.
