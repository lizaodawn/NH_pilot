also in the case of his late majesty augustus, whom the whole of mankind enrols in the list of happy men, if all the facts were carefully weighed, great revolutions of man's lot could be discovered: his failure with his uncle in regard to the office of master of the horse, when the candidate opposing him, lepidus, was preferred; the hatred caused by the proscription; his association in the triumvirate with the wickedest citizens, and that not with an equal share of power but with antony predominant; his flight in the battle of philippi when he was suffering from disease, and his three days' hiding in a marsh, in spite of his illness and his swollen dropsical condition (as stated by agrippa and maecenas); his shipwreck off sicily, and there also another period of hiding in a cave; his entreaties to proculeius to kill him, in the naval rout when a detachment of the enemy was already pressing close at hand; the anxiety of the struggle at perugia, the alarm of the battle of actium, his fall from a tower in the pannonian wars; and all the mutinies in his troops, all his critical illnesses, his suspicion of marcellus's ambitions, the disgrace of agrippa's banishment, the many plots against his life, the charge of causing the death of his children; and his sorrows that were not due solely to bereavement, his daughter's [julia] adultery and the disclosure of her plots against her father's life, the insolent withdrawal of his stepson nero, another adultery, that of his grand-daughter; then the long series of misfortunes - lack of army funds, rebellion of illyria, enlistment of slaves, shortage of man power, plague at rome, famine in italy, resolve on suicide and death more than half achieved by four days' starvation; next the disaster of varus and the foul slur upon his dignity; the disowning of postumus agrippa after his adoption as heir, and the sense of loss that followed his banishment; then his suspicion in regard to fabius and the betrayal of secrets; afterwards the intrigues of his wife and tiberius that tormented his latest days. in fine, this god - whether deified more by his own action or by his merits i know not - departed from life leaving his enemy's son his heir.
