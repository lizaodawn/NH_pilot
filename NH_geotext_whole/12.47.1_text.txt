the palm-tree growing in egypt called the adipsos is used in a similar way to the behen-nut in perfumery, and is almost as much in request; it is green in colour, with the scent of a quince, and has no kernel inside it. it is gathered in autumn, a little before it begins to ripen. if left on the tree longer, it is called the palm-nut, and it turns black and has the property of making people who eat it intoxicated. the behen-nut is priced at two denarii a pound. the retailers also give the name of behen to the dregs of the unguent made from it.
