it is an amusing trait in the mullet that when frightened it hides its head and thinks it is entirely concealed. the same fish is so incautious in its wantonness that in phoenicia and in the province of narbonne at the breeding season a male mullet from the fishponds is sent out into the sea with a long line tied to its gills through its mouth and when it is drawn back by the same line the females follow it to the shore, and again the males follow a female at the laying season.
