but the prize for navews goes to those grown at amiturnum. navews have almost the same nature as turnips: they are equally fond of cold places. they are sown even before the first of march, 4 sixteenths of a peck in an acre. the more careful growers recommend ploughing five times before sowing navew and four times for turnip, and manuring the ground in both cases; and they say that turnip grows a finer crop if the seed is ploughed in with some chaff. they advise that the sower should strip for the work, and should offer a prayer in the words, 'i sow for myself and my neighbours.' for both these kinds sowing is properly done between the holidays of two deities, neptune and vulcan, and as a result of careful observation it is said that these seeds give a wonderfully fine crop if they are sown on a day that is as many days after the beginning of the period specified as the moon was old when the first snow fell in the preceding winter. in warm and damp localities turnip and navew are also sown in spring.
