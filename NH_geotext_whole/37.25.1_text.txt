the first rank among these is held by 'carbunculi,' so-called because of their fiery appearance, although they are not affected by fire and are therefore sometimes known as 'acaustoe,' or 'incombustible' stones. two kinds of 'carbunculi' are the indian and the garamantic: the latter was called in greek the carthaginian because it was associated with the wealth of great carthage. to these varieties are added the ethiopian and that of alabanda, the latter being found, it is said, at orthosia in caria, but treated at alabanda. furthermore, in each variety there are so-called 'male' and 'female' stones, of which the former are the more brilliant, while the latter have a weaker lustre.
