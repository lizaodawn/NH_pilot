there is also a sea wormwood, called by some seriphum, the most approved growing at taposiris in egypt. at the ceremonies of isis the priests carry a branch of it ritually before them. narrower than the former, and less bitter, it is injurious to the stomach, but softens the bowels and expels intestinal worms. it is taken in drink with oil and salt, or infused into gruel of three-month wheat. a handful is boiled down in a sextarius of water to one-half.
