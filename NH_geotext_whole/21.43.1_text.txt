wonderful and worthy of record is what i have discovered about their food. hostilia is a village on the bank of the padus. when bee-fodder fails in the neighbourhood the natives place the hives on boats and carry them five miles upstream by night. at dawn the bees come out and feed, returning every day to the boats, which change their position until, when they have sunk low in the water under the mere weight, it is understood that the hives are full, and then they are taken back and the honey is extracted. in spain too for a like reason they carry the hives about on mules.
