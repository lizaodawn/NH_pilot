the first man in rome to cover with marble veneer whole walls in his house, which was on the caelian hill, was, according to cornelius nepos, mamurra, a roman knight and a native of formiae, who was gaius caesar's chief engineer in gaul. that such a man should have sponsored the invention is enough to make it utterly improper. for this is the mamurra who was reviled by catullus of verona in his poems, the mamurra whose house, as a matter of fact, proclaims more clearly than catullus himself that he 'possesses all that shaggy gaul possessed.' incidentally nepos adds also that he was the first to have only marble columns in his whole house and that these were all solid columns of carystus or luna marble.
