egyptian sori is most highly commended, being far superior to that of cyprus and spain and africa, although some people think that cyprus sori is more useful for treatment of the eyes; but whatever its provenance the best is that which has the most pungent odour, and which when ground up takes a greasy, black colour and becomes spongy. it is a substance that goes against the stomach so violently that with some people the mere smell of it causes vomiting. this is a description of the sori of egypt. that from other sources when ground up turns a bright colour like misy, and it is harder; however, if it is held in the cavities and used plentifully as a mouthwash it is good for toothache and for serious and creeping ulcers of the mouth. it is burnt on charcoal, like chalcitis.
