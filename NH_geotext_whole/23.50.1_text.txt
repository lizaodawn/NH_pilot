olive honey, which i have said exudes in syria from the olive trees themselves, has a taste like honey, relaxes the bowels, though not without nausea, and brings away bile in particular if two cyathi be given in a hemina of water. those who have drunk it become torpid and need to be roused at short intervals. those about to take part in drinking bouts take a cyathus of it beforehand. oil of pitch is used for cough, and for itch in cattle.
