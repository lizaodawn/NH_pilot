transformation of females into males is not an idle story. we find in the annals that in the consulship [171 bc] of publius licinius crassus and gaius cassius longinus a girl at casinum was changed into a boy, under the observation of the parents, and at the order of the augurs was conveyed away to a desert island. licinius mucianus has recorded that he personally saw at argos a man named arescon who had been given the name of arescusa and had actually married a husband, and then had grown a beard and developed masculine attributes and had taken a wife; and that he had also seen a boy with the same record at smyrna. i myself saw in africa a person who had turned into a male on the day of marriage to a husband; this was lucius constitius, a citizen of thysdritum....(it is said that) at the birth of twins neither the mother nor more than one of the two children usually lives, but that if twins are born that are of different sex it is even more unusual for either to be saved; that females are born more quickly than males, just as they grow older more quickly; and that movement in the womb is more frequent in the case of males, and males are usually carried on the right side, females on the left.
