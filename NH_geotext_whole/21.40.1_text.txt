at the most the life of the white violet is three years. after that time it degenerates. the rose lasts even for five years if it is neither pruned down nor burned; for by these means it renews its youth. we have also said that the soil makes a great difference. for in egypt all these flowers are without perfume, and the myrtle only has a remarkable one. in some places the buds of all form as much as two months before they do so elsewhere. rose beds ought to be dug over immediately after the west wind begins and again at the solstice, and great care should be taken that in the interval the ground be kept clean and sweet.
