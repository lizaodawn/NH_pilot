in egypt the most famous plant of this kind is the colocasia, called by some cyamos; they gather it out of the nile. the stalk of the stem when boiled and chewed breaks up into spidery threads, but the stem itself is handsome, jutting out from leaves which, even when compared with those of trees, are very broad, similar to the leaves called personata which are found in italian rivers. so much do the people of the nile appreciate the bounty of their river that they plait colocasia leaves into vessels of various shapes, which they consider make attractive goblets. the colocasia is now grown in italy.
