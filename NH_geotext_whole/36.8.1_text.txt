marcus lepidus, who was consul with quintus catulus, was the very first to lay down door-sills of numidian marble in his house; and for this he was sharply criticized. he was consul in the 676th year after the founding of the city. this is the first indication that i can find of the importing of numidian marble. the marble, however, was not in the form of columns or slabs, like that of carystus mentioned above, but came in blocks to be used in the most sordid manner - as door-sills! four years after the consulship of this lepidus came that of lucius lucullus, who gave his name, as is evident from the facts, to lucullean marble. he took a great delight in this marble and introduced it to rome, although it is in general black and all other marbles are favoured because of their markings or colours. it is found in the island of chios and is almost the only marble to have derived its name from that of a devotee. of these men, it was marcus scaurus, in my opinion, whose stage was the first structure to have marble walls, though i am not prepared to say whether these were of veneer or of solid polished blocks, as, for instance, is the case today with the walls of the temple of jupiter the thunderer on the capitol. for i find no evidence of marble veneer in italy that is as early as this.
