we next have urgo, a larger island, and capraria, which the greeks have called aegilion; then igilium and dianium, which they have also called artemisia, both of them opposite the coast of cosa; also barpana, maenaria, columbaria, and venaria. we then come to ilva with its iron mines, an island 100 miles in circumference, 10 miles distant from populonium, and called aethalia by the greeks: from it the island of planasia is distant 28 miles. after these, beyond the mouths of the tiber, and off the coast of antium, we come to astura, then palmaria and sinonia, and, opposite to formiae, pontiae. in the gulf of puteoli are pandateria, and prochyta, so called, not from the nurse of aeneas, but because it has been poured forth or detached from aenaria, an island which received its name from having been the anchorage of the fleet of aeneas, though called by homer inarime; it is also called pithecusa, not, as many have fancied, on account of the multitudes of apes found there, but from its extensive manufactories of pottery. between pausilipum and neapolis lies the island of megaris, and then, at a distance of eight miles from surrentum, capreae, famous for the castle of the emperor tiberius: it is eleven miles in circumference.
