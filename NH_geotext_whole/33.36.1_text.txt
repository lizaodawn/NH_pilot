minium or cinnabar also is found in silver mines; it is of great importance among pigments at the present day, and also in old times it not only had the highest importance but even sacred associations among the romans. verrius gives a list of writers of unquestionable authority who say that on holidays it was the custom for the face of the statue of jupiter himself to be coloured with cinnabar. as well as the bodies of persons going in a triumphal procession, and that camillus was so coloured in his triumph, and that under the same ritual it was usual even in their day for cinnabar to be added to the unguents used at a banquet in honour of a triumph, and that one of the first duties of the censors was to place a contract for painting jupiter with cinnabar. for my own part i am quite at a loss to explain the origin of this custom, although at the present day the pigment in question is known to be in demand among the nations of ethiopia whose chiefs colour themselves all over with it, and with whom the statues of the gods are of that colour. on that account we will investigate all the facts concerning it more carefully.
