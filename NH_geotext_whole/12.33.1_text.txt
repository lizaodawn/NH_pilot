some authorities have stated that myrrh is the product of a tree growing in the same forests among the frankincense-trees, but the majority say that it grows separately; and in fact it occurs in many places in arabia, as will appear when we deal with its varieties. a kind highly spoken of is also imported from islands, and the sabaei even cross the sea to the cave-dwellers' country to procure it. also a cultivated variety is produced which is much preferred to the wild kind. the plant enjoys being raked and having the soil round it loosened, as it is the better for having its roots cool.
