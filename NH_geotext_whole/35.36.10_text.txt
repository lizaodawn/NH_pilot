moreover it was a regular custom with apelles never to let a day of business to be so fully occupied that he did not practise his art by drawing a line, which has passed from him into a proverb. another habit of his was when he had finished his works to place them in a gallery in the view of passers by, and he himself stood out of sight behind the picture and listened to hear what faults were noticed, rating the public as a more observant critic than himself. and it is said that he was found fault with by a shoemaker because in drawing a subject's sandals he had represented the loops in them as one too few, and the next day the same critic was so proud of the artist's correcting the fault indicated by his previous objection that he found fault with the leg, but apelles indignantly looked out from behind the picture and rebuked him, saying that a shoemaker in his criticism must not go beyond the sandal - a remark that has also passed into a proverb. in fact he also possessed great courtesy of manners, which made him more agreeable to alexander the great, who frequently visited his studio - for, as we have said, alexander had published an edict forbidding any other artist to paint his portrait; but in the studio alexander used to talk a great deal about painting without any real knowledge of it, and apelles would politely advise him to drop the subject, saying that the boys engaged in grinding the colours were laughing at him: so much power did his authority exercise over a king who was otherwise of an irascible temper. and yet alexander conferred honour on him in a most conspicuous instance; he had such an admiration for the beauty of his favourite mistress, named pancaspe, that he gave orders that she should be painted in the nude by apelles, and then discovering that the artist while executing the commission had fallen in love with the woman, he presented her to him, great minded as he was and still greater owing to his control of himself, and of a greatness proved by this action as much as by any other victory: because he conquered himself, and presented not only his bedmate but his affection also to the artist, and was not even influenced by regard for the feelings of his favourite in having been recently the mistress of a monarch and now belonged to a painter. some persons believe that she was the model from which the aphrodite anadyomene (rising from the sea) was painted. it was apelles also who, kindly among his rivals, first established the reputation of protogenes at rhodes. protogenes was held in low esteem by his fellow-countrymen, as is usual with home products, and, when apelles asked him what price he set on some works he had finished, he had mentioned some small sum, but apelles made him an offer of fifty talents for them, and spread it about that he was buying them with the intention of selling them as works of his own. this device aroused the people of rhodes to appreciate the artist, and apelles only parted with the pictures to them at an enhanced price.
