in the aedileship of marcus scaurus there were 3000 statues on the stage in what was only a temporary theatre. mummius after conquering achaia filled the city with statues, though destined not to leave enough at his death to provide a dowry for his daughter - for why not mention this as well as the fact that excuses it? a great many were also imported by the luculli. yet it is stated by mucianus who was three times consul that there are still 3000 statues at rhodes, and no smaller number are believed still to exist at athens, olympia and delphi. what mortal man could recapitulate them all, or what value can be felt in such information? still it may give pleasure just to allude to the most remarkable and to name the artists of celebrity, though it would be impossible to enumerate the total number of the works of each, inasmuch as lysippus is said to have executed 1500 works of art, all of them so skilful that each of them by itself might have made him famous; the number is said to have been discovered after his decease, when his heir broke open his coffers, it having been his practice to put aside a coin of the value of one gold denarius out of what he got as reward for his handicraft for each statue.
