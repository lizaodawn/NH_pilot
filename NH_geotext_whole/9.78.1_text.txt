there has recently been sent to us a remarkable case of longevity in fishes. in campania not far from naples, there is a country house named posilipo; annaeus seneca writes that in caesar's fishponds on this property a fish thrown in by polio vedius had died after reaching the age of 60, while two others of the same breed that were of the same age were even then living. the mention of fishponds reminds me to say a little more on this topic before leaving the subject of aquatic animals.
