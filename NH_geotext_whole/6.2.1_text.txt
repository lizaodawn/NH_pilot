paphlagonia: beyond this river begins the nation of paphlagonia, by some writers called pylaemenia; it is closed in behind by the country of galatia. in it are mastya, a town founded by the milesians, and then cromna, at which spot cornelius nepos also places the heneti, from whom he would have us believe that the veneti of italy, who have a similar name, are descended. the city also of sesamon, now called amastris, mount cytorus, distant sixty-three miles from tium, the towns of cimolis and stephane, and the river parthenius. the promontory of carambis, which extends a great distance into the sea, is distant from the mouth of the euxine three hundred and twenty-five miles, or, according to some writers, three hundred and fifty, being the same distance from the cimmerian bosporus, or, as some persons think, only three hundred and twelve miles. there was formerly also a town of the same name, and another near it called armene; we now find there the colony of sinope, distant from mount cytorus one hundred and sixty-four miles. we then come to the river evarchus, and after that a people of the cappadocians, the towns of gaziura and gazelum, the river halys, which runs from the foot of mount taurus through cataonia and cappadocia, the towns of gangre and carusa, the free town of amisus, distant from sinope one hundred and thirty miles, and a gulf of the same name, of such vast extent as to make asia assume the form of a peninsula, the isthmus of which is only some two hundred miles in breadth, or a little more, across to the gulf of issos in cilicia. in all this district there are, it is said, only three races that can rightly be termed greeks, the dorians, the ionians, and the aeolians, all the rest being of barbarian origin. to amisus was joined the town of eupatoria, founded by mithridates: after his defeat they were both included under the name of pompeiopolis.
