the cyclades: beyond euboea, and out in the myrtoan sea, are numerous other islands; but those more especially famous are, glauconnesos and the aegila. off the promontory, too, of geraistos are the cyclades, lying in a circle around delos, from which circumstance they derive their name. the first of them is the one called andros with a city of the same name, distant from geraistos ten miles, and from ceos thirty-nine. myrsilus tells us that this island was at first called cauros, and after that antandros; callimachus calls it lasia, and others again nonagria, hydrussa, and epagris. it is ninety-three miles in circumference. at a distance of one mile from andros and of fifteen from delos, is tenos, with a city of the same name; this island is fifteen miles in length. aristotle says that it was formerly called hydrussa, from the abundance of water found here, while some writers call it ophiussa. the other islands are, myconos, with the mountain of dimastus, distant from delos fifteen miles; siphnos, formerly called meropia and acis, twenty-eight miles in circumference; seriphos, twelve miles in circuit; prepesinthus; cythnos; and then, by far the most famous among the cyclades, and lying in the very middle of them, delos itself; so famous for its temple of apollo, and its extensive commerce. this island long floated on the waves, and, as tradition says, was the only one that had never experienced an earthquake, down to the time of m. varro; mucianus however has informed us, that it has been twice so visited. aristotle states that this island received its name from the fact of its having so suddenly made its appearance on emerging from the sea; aglaosthenes, however, gives it the name of cynthia, and others of ortygia, asteria, lagia, chlamydia, cynthus, and, from the circumstance of fire having been first discovered here, pyrpile. its circumference is five miles only; mount cynthus here raises his head.
