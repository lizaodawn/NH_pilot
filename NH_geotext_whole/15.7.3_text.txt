the colour of pitch-oil is reddish yellow. there is an oil that grows of its own accord in the coastal parts of syria called elaeomeli. it is a rich oil that trickles from trees, of a substance thicker than honey but thinner than resin, and having a sweet flavour; this also is used by the doctors. there is also a use of old olive-oil for certain kinds of diseases, and it is also deemed to be serviceable for preserving ivory from decay: at all events, the inside of the statue of saturn at rome has been filled with oil.
