there is a snake, a colubra, that lives in the water. it is said that, if they have its fat or gall on their persons, crocodile hunters are helped wonderfully, as the brute dares not attack it at all; it is still more efficacious when combined with the plant potamogiton. fresh river-crabs pounded and taken in water, their ash preserved, are good for all poisons, being specific for scorpion stings, if taken with asses milk, or failing that with goat's or any other milk; wine too should be added. pounded with basil and applied to scorpions, river-crabs kill them. their property avails also against the bites of all venomous creatures, being specific against the scytale, snakes, sea-hare, and bramble toad. their ash preserved is good for those threatened with hydrophobia from the bite of a mad dog. some add gentian and administer in wine, and if hydrophobia has already set in, prescribe lozenges made with the ash and wine to be swallowed. the magi indeed assert that if ten crabs with a handful of basil are tied together, all the scorpions of the district will collect to the spot, and to those wounded by scorpions they apply with basil either crabs themselves or else their ash. for all these purposes sea crabs are less efficacious. thrasyllus avows that no antidote for snakebite is as good as crabs; that pigs, when bitten, cure themselves by taking crabs as food; and that when the sun is in cancer snakes are in torture. the stings of scorpions are counteracted also by the flesh of river snails, raw or cooked. some too keep them for this purpose preserved in salt. they also apply them to the wounds themselves. though the fish called coracini are peculiar to the nile, i am giving this information for the benefit of all lands. application of their flesh is good for scorpion stings. among poisonous parts of fishes are the prickles on the back of the sea-pig, a wound from which causes severe torture. a remedy is the slime from the liquid part of the body of these fishes.
