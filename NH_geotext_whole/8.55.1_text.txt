the mice of the black sea region also hibernate at all events the white ones, which are stated to have a very discriminating palate, though i am curious to know how the authorities detected this. alpine mice, [marmots] which are the size of badgers, also hibernate, but these carry a supply of fodder into their caves beforehand. some people say that they let themselves down into their cave in a string, male and female alternately holding the next one's tail in their teeth, and lying on their backs, embracing a bundle of grass that they have bitten off at the roots, and that consequently at this season their backs show marks of rubbing. there are also mice resembling these in egypt, and they sit back on their haunches in a similar way, and walk on two feet and use their fore-paws as hands.
