also, as we began on this topic from the subject of rings, it is suitable incidentally to point out that the official in charge of the temple of jupiter of the capitol when he was arrested broke the stone of his ring between his teeth and at once expired, so putting an end to any possibility of proving the theft. it follows that there was only 2,000 lbs. weight of gold at the outside when rome was captured in its 364th year, although the census showed there were already 152,573 free citizens. from the same city 307 years later the gold that gaius marius the younger [82 bc] had conveyed to praeneste from the conflagration of the temple of the capitol and from all the other shrines amounted to 14,000 lbs., which with a placard above it to that effect was carried along in his triumphal procession by sulla, as well as [81bc] 6,000 lbs. weight of silver. sulla had likewise on the previous day carried in procession 15,000 lbs. of gold and 115,000 lbs. of silver as the proceeds of all the rest of his victories.
