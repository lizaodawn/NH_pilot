all the other animals have a fixed season both for copulation and for bearing offspring, but human reproduction takes place all the year round and the period of gestation varies - in one case it may exceed six months, in another seven, and it may even exceed ten; a child born before the seventh month is usually still born. only those conceived the day before or the day after full moon, or when there is no moon, are born in the seventh month. it is a common thing in egypt for children to be born even in the eighth month; and indeed in italy also for such cases to live, contrary to the belief of old times. these matters vary in more ways also. vistilia the wife of glitius and subsequently of pomponius and of orfitius, citizens of the highest distinction, bore these husbands four children, in each case after six months' pregnancy, but subsequently gave birth to suillius rufus after ten months and corbulo after six - both of these became consuls - and subsequently bore caesonia, the consort of the emperor gaius, after seven months. infants born in this number of months are weakest in health during the first six weeks, the mothers in the fourth and eighth months of pregnancy; and abortions in these cases are fatal. masurius states that lucius papirius as praetor in a suit for an estate brought by an heir presumptive gave judgement for the defendant; the plaintiff's case was that the heir apparent's mother said that he had been born after thirteen months' pregnancy, and the ground for the judgement was that there appeared to be no fixed period of pregnancy.
