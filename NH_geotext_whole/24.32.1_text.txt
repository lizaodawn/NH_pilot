the clusters of the white poplar, as i have already described, are used in making unguents. a draught made from the bark is good for sciatica and strangury, and the juice of the leaves, warmed, for earache. those who hold in their hand a twig of poplar need not fear chafing between the legs. the black poplar that grows in crete is considered the most efficacious; the seed in vinegar is good for epilepsy. it also discharges a small quantity of resin, which is used for poultices. a decoction of the leaves in vinegar is applied locally for gout. the moisture exuding from the hollows of the black poplar, and giving out an odour when applied with rubbing, removes warts and pimples. poplars also produce on their leaves drops from which bees make bee-glue. with water these drops also have the same healing properties as bee-glue.
