the name that appears in these writers immediately after 'ceraunia' is that of the so-called 'iris,' or 'rainbow stone.' it is dug up on an island in the red sea 60 miles distant from the city of berenice. in every other respect it is merely rock-crystal, and is sometimes called 'root of crystal' for this reason. it is known as 'iris' in token of its appearance, for when it is struck by the sunlight in a room it casts the appearance and colours of a rainbow on the walls near by, continually altering its tints and ever causing more and more astonishment because of its extremely changeable effects. it is agreed that it has hexagonal faces, like the rock-crystal, but some people assert that it has rough faces and unequal angles; and that in full sunlight it scatters the beams that shine upon it, and yet at the same time lights up adjacent objects by projecting a kind of gleam in front of itself. but, as i have said, it does not produce any colours except in a dark place; and even then, the effect is not as though the stone itself contained the colours, but rather as though it were forcing them to rebound from the wall. the best kind is that which produces the spectra that are the largest in size with the closest resemblance to a rainbow. there is also another 'rainbow stone,' the 'iritis,' which is similar to the former in every respect except that it is very hard. according to orus, this when burnt and crushed to a powder cures ichneumon bites, but is actually found in persis.
