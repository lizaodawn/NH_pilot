some fish have numerous gills, others single ones, others double. with the gills they discharge the water taken in by the mouth. hardening of the scales, which are not alike in all fishes, is a sign of age. there are two lakes in italy at the foot of the alps, named como and maggiore, in which every year at the rising of the pleiades fish are found that are remarkable for close-set and very sharp scales, shaped like shoe-nails, but they are not commonly seen for a longer period than about a month from then.
