the birth of triplets is attested by the case of the horatii and curiatii; above that number is considered portentous, except in egypt, where drinking the water of the nile causes fecundity. recently on the day of the obsequies of his late majesty augustus a certain woman of the lower orders named fausta at ostia was delivered of two male and two female infants, which unquestionably portended the food shortage that followed. we also find the case of a woman in the peloponnese who four times produced quintuplets, the greater number of each birth surviving. in egypt also trogus alleges cases of seven infants born at a single birth. persons are also born of both sexes combined - what we call hermaphrodites, formerly called androgyni and considered as portents, but now as entertainments. pompey the great among the decorations of his theatre placed images of celebrated marvels, made with special elaboration for the purpose by the talent of eminent artists; among them we read of eutychis who at tralles was carried to her funeral pyre by twenty children and who had given birth 30 times, and alcippe who gave birth to an elephant - although it is true that the latter case ranks among portents, for one of the first occurrences of the marsian war was that a maidservant gave birth to a snake, and also monstrous births of various kinds are recorded among the ominous things that happened. claudius caesar writes that a hippo-centaur was born in thessaly and died the same day; and in his reign we actually saw one that was brought here for him from egypt preserved in honey. one case is that of an infant at saguntum which at once went back into the womb, in the year [218 bc] in which that city was destroyed by hannibal.
