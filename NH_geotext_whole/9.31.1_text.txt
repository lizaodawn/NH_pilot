with a fish of this kind one of the proconsular body, asinius celer, in the principate of gaius, issued a challenge - it is not so easy to say who won the match - to all the spendthrifts by giving 8000 sesterces for a mullet. the thought of this sidetracks the mind to the consideration of the people who in their complaints about luxury used to protest that cooks were being bought at a higher price per man than a horse; but now the price of three horses is given for a cook, and the price of three cooks for a fish, and almost no human being has come to be more valued than one that is most skilful in making his master bankrupt. licinius mucianus has recorded the capture in the red sea of a mullet weighing 80 lbs.; what price would our epicures have paid for it if it had been found on the coasts near the city?
