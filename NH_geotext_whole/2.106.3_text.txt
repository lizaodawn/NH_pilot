it is accredited by the mucianus who was three times consul that the water flowing from a spring in the temple of father liber on the island of andros always has the flavour of wine on january 5th: the day is called god's gift day. to drink of the styx near nonacris in arcadia causes death on the spot, although the river is not peculiar in smell or colour; similarly three springs on mount liberosus in taurica irremediably but painlessly cause death. in the carrinensis territory in spain there are two adjacent springs of which one rejects all objects and the other sucks them down; another in the same nation makes all the fish in it look of a golden colour, although except when in that water there is nothing peculiar about them. in the district by the larium lake of como a copious spring always swells up and sinks back again every hour. a hot spring on the island of cydonea off lesbos flows only in the springtime. lake sannaus in asia is dyed by the wormwood springing up round it. in the cave of clarian apollo at colophon there is a pool a draught from which causes marvellous oracular utterances to be produced, though the life of the drinkers is shortened. even our generation has seen rivers flow backward at nero's last moments, as we have recorded in our history of that emperor.
