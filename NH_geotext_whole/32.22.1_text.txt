seaweed too is said by nicander to be an antidote. there are many kinds of it, as i have one with a long, red leaf, another with a broader leaf, and a third with a curly one. the most prized is the one growing near the ground in the island of crete among the rocks, for this dyes even wool with a colour so fixed that it cannot be washed out afterwards. nicander recommends it to be given in wine.
