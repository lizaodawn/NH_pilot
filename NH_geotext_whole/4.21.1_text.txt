euboia: euboea itself has also been rent away from boeotia; the channel of the euripus, which flows between them, being so narrow as to admit of the opposite shores being united by a bridge. at the south, this island is remarkable for its two promontories, that of geraistos, which looks towards attica, and that of caphareus, which faces the hellespont; on the north it has that of kenaion. in no part does this island extend to a greater breadth than forty miles, while it never contracts to less than two. in length it runs along the whole coast of boeotia, extending from attica as far as thessaly, a distance of 150 miles. in circumference it measures 365, and is distant from the hellespont, on the side of caphareus, 225 miles. the cities for which it was formerly famous were, pyrrha, porthmos, nesos, cerinthos, oreus, dium, aedepsus, ocha, and oichalia; at present it is ennobled by those of chalcis(opposite which, on the mainland, is aulis), geraistos, eretria, carystus, oritanum, and artemisium. here are also the fountain of arethusa, the river lelantos, and the warm springs known as ellopiae; it is still better known, however, for the marble of carystus. this island used formerly to be called chalcodontis and macris, as we learn from dionysius and ephorus; according to aristides, macra; also, as callidemus says, chalcis, because copper was first discovered here. menaechmus says that it was called abantias, and the poets generally give it the name of asopis.
