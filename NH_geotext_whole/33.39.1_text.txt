in old times 'dragon's-blood' cinnabar was used for painting the pictures that are still called monochromes, 'in one colour.' cinnabar from ephesus was also used for painting, but this has been given up because pictures in that colour were a great amount of trouble to preserve. moreover both colours were thought excessively harsh; consequently painters have gone over to red-ochre and sinopic ochre, pigments about which i shall speak in the proper places. cinnabar is adulterated with goat's blood or with crushed service-berries. the price of genuine cinnabar is 50 sesterces a pound.
