a tree to some extent resembling the egyptian fig is one in crete called the cyprian fig, as it also bears fruit on its actual trunk and on its branches when they have grown to thickness. but the cyprian fig puts out a bud without any leaves, resembling a root. the trunk of the tree is like a poplar, and the leaf like an elm. it bears fruit four times a year, and also buds the same number of times, but its unripe figs will not ripen unless an incision is made in them to let out the juice. they have the sweet taste and the inside of the common fig, and are the size of a service-tree berry.
