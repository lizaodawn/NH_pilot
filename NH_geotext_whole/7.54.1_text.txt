cremation was not actually an old practice at rome: the dead used to be buried. but cremation was instituted after it became known that the bodies of those fallen in wars abroad were dug up again. all the same many families kept on the old ritual, for instance it is recorded that nobody in the family of the cornelii was cremated before sulla the dictator, and that he had desired it because he was afraid of reprisals for having dug up the corpse of gaius marius. [but burial is understood to denote any mode of disposal of a corpse, but interment means covering up with earth.]
