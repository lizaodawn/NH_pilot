some plants produce their fruits in the earth, others outside as well, others only outside. some grow lying on the ground, for instance gourds and cucumbers; these also grow in a hanging position, though they are much heavier even than fruits that grow on trees, but the cucumber is composed of cartilage and flesh and the gourd of rind and cartilage; the gourd is the only fruit whose rind when ripe changes into a woody substance. radishes, navews and turnips are hidden in the earth, and so in a different way are elecampane, skirret and parsnips. some plants we shall call of the fennel class, for instance dill and mallow; for authorities report that in arabia mallows grow into trees in seven months, and serve as walking-sticks. there is an instance of a mallow-tree on the estuary of the town of lixus in mauretania, the place where the gardens of the hesperids are said to have been situated; it grows 200 yards from the ocean, near a shrine of hercules which is said to be older than the one at cadiz; the tree itself is 20 ft. high, and so large round that nobody could span it with his arms. hemp will also be placed in a similar class. moreover there are also some plants to which we shall give the name of 'fleshy', for instance the spongy plants that grow in water-meadows. as to the tough flesh of funguses, we have mentioned it already in treating the nature of timber and of trees, and in the ease of another class, that of truffles, a short time ago.
