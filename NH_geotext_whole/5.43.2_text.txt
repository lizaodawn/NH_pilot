in the interior of bithynia are the colony of apamea, the agrippenses, the juliopolitae, and bithynion; the rivers syrium, laphias, pharnacias, alces, serinis, lilaeus, scopius, and hieras, which separates bithynia from galatia. beyond chalcedon formerly stood chrysopolis, and then nicopolis, of which the gulf, upon which stands the port of amycus, still retains the name; then the promontory of naulochum, and estiae, a temple of neptune. we then come to the bosporus, which again separates asia from europe, the distance across being half a mile; it is distant twelve miles and a half from chalcedon. the first entrance of this strait is eight miles and three-quarters wide, at the place where the town of spiropolis formerly stood. the thyni occupy the whole of the coast, the bithyni the interior. this is the termination of asia, and of the 282 peoples, that are to be found between the gulf of lycia and this spot. we have already mentioned the length of the hellespont and propontis to the thracian bosporus as being 239 miles; from chalcedon to sigeum, isidorus makes the distance 322 1/2.
