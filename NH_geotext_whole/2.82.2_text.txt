earthquakes are more frequent in autumn and spring, as is lightning. consequently the gallic provinces and egypt suffer very little from them, as in the latter the summer is the cause that prevents them and in the former the winter. similarly they are more frequent by night than in the daytime. the severest earthquakes occur in the morning and the evening, but they are frequent near dawn and in the daytime about noon. they also occur at an eclipse of the sun or moon, since then storms are lulled, but particularly when heat follows rain or rain heat.
