many people consider that for the preservation of unguents there is little to choose between onyx marble and the 'lygdinus,' which is found in paros in pieces no larger than a dish or mixing bowl, although in earlier times it was normally imported only from arabia. it is of an exceptionally brilliant whiteness. two stones of a directly opposed character are also greatly esteemed. there is the coral stone found in the province of asia in sizes not exceeding two cubits, with a white colour close to that of ivory and a certain resemblance to it in appearance. on the other hand, the stone named after alabanda, its place of origin, although it occurs also at miletus, is black. in appearance, however, this stone tends rather to have a reddish tinge. it can, moreover, be melted by fire and fused to serve as glass. the thebaie stone mottled with gold spots is found in a part of africa that has been assigned to egypt and is naturally well adapted for use as stones on which to grind eye-salves. the granite of syene is found in the neighbourhood of syene in the thebaid and in earlier times was known as pyrrhopoecilos.
