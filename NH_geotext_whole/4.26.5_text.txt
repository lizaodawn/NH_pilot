leaving taphrae, and going along the mainland, we find in the interior the auchetae, in whose country the hypanis has its rise, as also the neuroe, in whose district the borysthenes has its source, the geloni, the thyssagetae, the budini, the basilidae, and the agathyrsi with their azure-coloured hair. above them are the nomades, and then a nation of anthropophagi or cannibals. on leaving lake buges, above the lake maeotis we come to the sauromatae and the essedones. along the coast, as far as the river tanais, are the maeotae, from whom the lake derives its name, and the last of all, in the rear of them, the arimaspi. we then come to the riphaean mountains, and the region known by the name of pterophoros, because of the perpetual fall of snow there, the flakes of which resemble feathers; a part of the world which has been condemned by the decree of nature to lie immersed in thick darkness; suited for nothing but the generation of cold, and to be the asylum of the chilling blasts of the northern winds.
