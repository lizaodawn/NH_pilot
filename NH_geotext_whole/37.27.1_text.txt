there is also a stone called 'anthracitis,' which is dug up in thesprotia and resembles charcoal. statements that it is found in liguria i consider to be false, unless it is a fact that it was found there when the statements were made. among these stones there are said to be some that are surrounded by a white vein. the 'anthracitis' has the fiery colour of the stones previously mentioned, but it possesses one peculiar property: when it is touched its glow dies away and disappears, but when, on the other hand, it is soaked with water it blazes forth again.
