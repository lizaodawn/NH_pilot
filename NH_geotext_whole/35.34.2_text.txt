in this department the exactitude of the greeks is inconsistent, in placing the painters many olympiads after the sculptors in bronze and chasers in metal, and putting the first in the 90th olympiad, although it is said that even pheidias himself was a painter to begin with, and that there was a shield at athens that had been painted by him; and although moreover it is universally admitted that his brother panaenus came in the 83rd olympiad, who painted the inner surface of a shield of athene at elis made by colotes, pheidias's pupil and assistant in making the statue of olympian zeus. and then, is it not equally admitted that candaules, the last king of lydia of the heraclid line, who was also commonly known by the name of myrsilus, gave its weight in gold for a picture of the painter bularchus representing a battle 'with the magnetes.' so high was the value already set on the art of painting. this must have occurred at about the time of romulus, since candaules died in the 18th olympiad, or, according to some accounts, in the same year as romulus, making it clear, if i am not mistaken, and that the art had already achieved celebrity, and in fact a perfection. and if we are bound to accept this conclusion, it becomes clear at the same time that the first stages were at a much earlier date and that the painters in monochrome, whose date is not handed down to us, came considerably earlier - hygiaenon, dinias, charmadas and eumarus of athens, the last being the earliest artist to distinguish the male from the female sex in painting, and venturing to reproduce every sort of figure; and cimon of kleonai who improved on the inventions of eumarus. it was cimon who first invented 'catagrapha,' that is, images in 'three-quarter,' and who varied the aspect of the features, representing them as looking backward or upward or downward; he showed the attachments of the limbs, displayed the veins, and moreover introduced wrinkles and folds in the drapery. indeed the brother of pheidias, panaenus, even painted the battle at marathon between the athenians and persians; so widely established had the employment of colour now become and such perfection of art had been attained that he is said to have introduced actual portraits of the generals who commanded in that battle, miltiades, callimachus and cynaegirus on the athenian side and datis and artaphernes on that of the barbarians.
