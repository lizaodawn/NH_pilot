further, the art of former days did not fail to provide a more humane function even for iron. when the artist aristonidas desired to represent the madness of athamas subsiding in repentance after he had hurled his son learchus from the rock, he made a blend of copper and iron, in order that the blush of shame should be represented by rust of the iron shining through the brilliant surface of the copper; this statue is still standing at rhodes. there is also in the same city an iron figure of heracles, which was made by alcon, prompted by the endurance displayed by the god in his labours. we also see at rome goblets of iron dedicated in the temple of mars the avenger. the same benevolence of nature has limited the power of iron itself by inflicting on it the penalty of rust, and the same foresight by making nothing in the world more mortal than that which is most hostile to mortality.
