italy saw elephants for the first time in the war with king pyrrhus, and called them lucan oxen because they were seen in lucania, 280 bc.; but rome first saw them at a date five years later, in a triumph, and also a very large number that were captured from the carthaginians in sicily by the victory of the pontiff lucius metellus, 252 b.c. there were 142 of them, or by some accounts 140, and they had been brought over on rafts that metellus constructed by laying decks on rows of casks lashed together. verrius records that they fought in the circus and were killed with javelins, because it was not known what use to make of them, as it had been decided not to keep them nor to present them to native kings; lucius piso says that they were merely led into the circus, and in order to increase the contempt felt for them were driven all round it by attendants carrying spears with a button on the point. the authorities who do not think that they were killed do not explain what was done with them afterwards.
