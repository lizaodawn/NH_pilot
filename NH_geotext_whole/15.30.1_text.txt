before the victory of lucius lucullus in the war against mithridates, that is down to 74 bc., there were no cherry-trees in italy. lucullus first imported them from pontus, and in 120 years they have crossed the ocean and got as far as britain; but all the same no attention has succeeded in getting them to grow in egypt. of cherries the apronian are the reddest, and the lutatian the blackest, while the caecilian kind are perfectly round. the junian cherry has an agreeable flavour but practically only if eaten under the tree on which it grows, as it is so delicate that it does not stand carriage. the highest rank, however, belongs to the bigaroon cherry called by the campanians the plinian cherry, but in belgium to the lusitanian, and so also on the banks of the rhine. this cherry has a third kind of colour, a blend of black, bright red and green, which looks as if the fruit were always not quite ripe. it is less than five years ago that what is called the laurel-cherry was introduced, which has a not disagreeable bitter flavour, and is produced by grafting a cherry on a bay-tree. there are also macedonian cherries, grown on a tree of small size and rarely exceeding four and half feet in height, and ground-cherries, with a still smaller bush. the cherry is one of the earliest fruits to repay its yearly gratitude to the farmer. it likes a north aspect and cold conditions; moreover it can be dried in the sun and stored in casks like olives.
