all the country, after we pass meroe, is bounded by the troglodytae and the red sea, it being three days' journey from napata to the shores of that sea; throughout the whole of this district the rain water is carefully preserved at several places, while the country that lies between is extremely productive of gold. the parts beyond this are inhabited by the adabuli, a nation of aethiopia; and here, over against meroe, are the megabarri, by some writers called the adiabari; they occupy the city of apollo; some of them, however, are nomades, living on the flesh of elephants. opposite to them, on the african side, dwell the macrobii, and then again, beyond the megabarri, there are the memnones and the dabeli, and, at a distance of twenty days' journey, the critensi. beyond these are the dochi, and then the gymnetes, who always go naked; and after them the andetae, the mothitae, the mesaches, and the ipsodorae, who are of a black tint, but stain the body all over with a kind of red earth. on the african side again there are the medimni, and then a nation of nomades, who live on the milk of the cynocephalus, and then the aladi and the syrbotae, which last are said to be eight cubits in height.
