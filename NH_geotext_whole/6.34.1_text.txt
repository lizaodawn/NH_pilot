troglodytice: troglodytice comes next, by the ancients called midoe, and by some michoe; here is mount pentedactylos, some islands called stenae deirae, the halonnesi, a group of islands not less in number, cardamine, and topazos, which last has given its name to the precious stone so called. the gulf is full of islands; those known as mareu are supplied with fresh water, those called erenos, are without it; these were ruled by governors appointed by the kings. in the interior are the candei, also called ophiophagi, a people in the habit of eating serpents; there is no region in existence more productive of them.
