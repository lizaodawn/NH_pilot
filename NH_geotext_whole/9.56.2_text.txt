there used to be commonly found in our own sea, and more frequently on the coasts of the thracian bosphorus, small red gems contained in the shells called mussels. but in acarnania there grows what is termed the sea-pen; which shows that pearls are not born in only one kind of shell, for juba also records that the arabs have a shell resembling a toothed comb, that bristles like a hedgehog, and has an actual pearl, resembling a hailstone, in the fleshy part; this kind of shell is not imported to rome. and there are not found in acarnania the formerly celebrated pearls of an exceptional size and almost a marble colour. better ones are found round actium, but these too are small, and in sea-board mauretania. alexander the encyclopaedist and sudines think that they grow old and let their colour evaporate.
