moreover, as this one element has a fertile principle that engenders itself and grows out of the smallest sparks, what must be expected to happen in future among all these funeral pyres of the earth? what is the natural principle that pastures a most voracious appetite on the whole world while itself unimpaired? add thereto the innumerable stars and the mighty sun, add the fires of man's making and also those implanted in the nature of stone and of timber rubbing against itself, and again the fire of clouds, and the sources of thunderbolts - and doubtless all marvels will be surpassed by the fact that there has ever been a single day on which there has not been a universal conflagration, when also hollow mirrors facing the sun's rays set things alight more easily than any other fire. what of the countless small but natural eruptions of fire? in the river nymphaeus a flame comes out of a rock that is kindled by rain; also one comes out at the scantian springs, not a strong one, it is true, as it passes away, and not lasting long on any substance which it touches - an ash tree shading this fiery spring is everlastingly green; one comes out in the district of mutina on the days appointed as sacred to vulcan. it is found in the authorities that in the fields lying under aricia if charcoal is dropped on the ground, the earth is set on fire; that in the sabine and sidicine district a stone flames up when oiled; that in the sallentine town of egnatia, if wood is put on a certain sacred rock, a flame at once shoots up; that ashes on the altar of juno at lacinium, which stands in the open air, remains motionless when stormy winds sweep over it in every direction. moreover, it is recorded that sudden fires arise both in pools of water and in bodies, even human bodies: valerius antias tells that the whole of lake trasimene once was on fire; that when servius tullius was a boy a flame flashed out from his head while he was asleep; and that a similar flame burnt on lucius marcius in spain when he was making a speech after the death of the scipios and exhorting the soldiers to revenge. later we shall give more instances, and more in detail; for at the present we are displaying a sort of medley of marvels of all the elements. but leaving the interpretation of nature our mind hastens to lead the reader's attention by the hand on a tour of the whole world.
