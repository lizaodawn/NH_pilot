but there are other inventions also that belong to earth herself. for who could sufficiently marvel at the fact that the most inferior portion of the earth's substance, which is in consequence designated dust, on the hills of pozzuoli, encounters the waves of the sea and as soon as it is submerged turns into a single mass of stone that withstands the attacks of the waves and becomes stronger every day, especially if it mixed with broken quarry-stone from cumae? in the cyzicus district also the nature of the earth is the same, but there not dust but the earth itself is cut out in blocks of any size wanted and plunged into the sea; and when drawn out, it is of the consistency of stone. the same is said to take place in the neighbourhood of cassandreae and it is stated that in a fresh water spring at cnidus earth becomes petrified in less than eight months. or the coast from oropus to aulis all the earth that the sea touches is turned into rocks. the finest portion of the sand from the nile is not very different from the dust of pozzuoli, not to be used for an embankment against the sea and to act as a breakwater against waves, but for the purpose of subduing men's bodies for the exercises of the wrestling school. at all events it used to be imported from there for patrobius, a freedman of the emperor nero, and moreover i also find that this sand was carried with other military commodities for alexander the great's generals craterus, leonnatus and meleager, though i shall not say more about this part of the subject any more than, by heaven, i shall mention the use of earth in making ointments, employed by our young men while ruining their vigour of mind by exercising their muscles.
