it is recognised at once, as its properties are less potent, for the smallest quantity of true dittany, taken in drink, bums the mouth. those who gather them store them in a piece of fennel-giant or reed, which they tie up at the ends, to prevent their losing efficacy. there are some who say that both plants grow in many places, but that while the inferior kinds are found on rich soils, true dittany is only seen on rough ground. there is also a third plant called dittany, unlike the others in appearance and properties; the leaves are those of sisymbrium and the branches are larger, but there is the established conviction that whatever simple grows in crete is infinitely superior to any of the same kind to be found elsewhere, and that the next best herbs are those to be found on mount parnassus. report says that simples grow besides on mount pelion in thessaly, on mount telethrius in euboea, and throughout arcadia and laconia, and that the arcadians indeed use, not medicines, but milk in the spring season, because it is at this time chiefly that herbs are swollen with juices which, when the beasts graze, medicate their udders. but the milk they drink is cow's milk, since kine will feed on almost any kind of plant. the potency of plants becomes clear from two striking examples of their action even on quadrupeds: horses that have grazed around abdera and what is called 'the bounds of diomedes' go raving mad, as do also the asses that graze around potniae.
