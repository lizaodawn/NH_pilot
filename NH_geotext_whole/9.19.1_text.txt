fishes of all kinds grow up exceptionally fast, especially in the black sea; this is due to the fresh water carried into it by a large number of rivers. the name of scomber is given to a fish whose growth in size can be noticed daily. this fish and the pelamys in company with the tunny enter the black sea in shoals in search of less brackish feeding-grounds, each kind with its own leaders, and first of all the mackerel, which when in the water is sulphur-coloured, though out of water it is the same colour as the other kinds. these fill the fish-ponds of spain, the tunny not going with them.
