corinth and the part of greece around it call brya a tree of which they distinguish two kinds: the wild, which is absolutely barren, and the cultivated. the latter in egypt and syria bears, and that abundantly, large-stoned fruit bigger than a gall-nut and bitter to the taste, which physicians use instead of gall-nuts in the medical mixtures which they call antherae. the wood also, and the blossom, leaves and bark, are used for the same purposes, although they are less potent. the pounded bark is given for the spitting of blood and for excessive menstruation, also to sufferers from coeliac disease. an application of the same bark pounded checks all kinds of gatherings. from the leaves is extracted a juice employed for the same purposes. the leaves are also decocted in wine; but by themselves with honey added they are applied to gangrenous sores. a decoction of them taken in wine or the leaves themselves applied locally with rose oil and wax are soothing. so used they also cure epinyctis; a decoction of them is healing to toothache and earache; the root is similarly used for the same purposes. the leaves furthermore are applied with pearl barley to spreading ulcers. a drachma by weight of the seed is taken in drink for the poison of phalangia and other spiders; it is applied however with chicken fat to boils. it is an antidote also to the poison of serpents except that of the asp. it is also good for jaundice, phthiriasis and nits, if a decoction is used as a liniment, and this too checks excessive menstruation. the ash from the tree is good for all the same purposes. they say that if it is mixed with the urine of a castrated ox and taken in either drink or food it is antaphrodisiac. a burning coal of this wood is quenched with the urine mentioned and kept in the shade. this, when you want to light it, crumbles to powder. the magi have recorded that the urine of a eunuch also has the same effect.
