in the neighbourhood of munda in spain, the place where julius caesar defeated cn. pompeius, occur stones containing the likeness of a palm branch, which appears whenever they are broken. there are also black stones, like that of taenarum, that have come to be esteemed as much as any marble. varro states that black stones from africa are harder than the italian, but that, on the other hand, the white stone of cora is harder than that of paros. he mentions too that carrara stone can be cut with a saw, that tusculan stone is split by fire and that the dark sabine variety actually becomes bright if oil is poured on it. varro also assures us that rotary querns have been found at bolsena; and we find in records of miraculous occurrences that some querns have even moved of their own accord.
