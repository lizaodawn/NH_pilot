after pausias, euphranor the isthmian distinguished himself far before all others, in the 104th olympiad; he has also appeared in our account of statuaries. his works included colossal statues, works in marble, and reliefs, as he was exceptionally studious and diligent, excelling in every field and never falling below his own level. this artist seems to have been the first fully to represent the lofty qualities of heroes, and to have achieved good proportions, but he was too slight in his structure of the whole body and too large in his heads and joints. he also wrote books about proportions and about colours. works of his are a cavalry battle, the twelve gods, and a theseus, in respect of which he said that parrhasius's theseus had lived on a diet of roses, but his was a beef-eater. there is a celebrated picture by him at ephesus, odysseus feigning madness and yoking an ox with a horse, with men in cloaks reflecting, and the leader sheathing his sword.
