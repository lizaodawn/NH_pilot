i shall now proceed to compare the dimensions of the various parts of the earth, however great the difficulties which may arise from the discrepancy of the accounts given by various authors: the most convenient method, however, will be that of adding the breadth to the length. following this mode of reckoning, the dimensions of europe will be eight thousand two hundred and ninety-four miles; of africa, to adopt a mean between all the various accounts given by authors, the length is three thousand seven hundred and ninety-four miles, while the breadth, so far as it is inhabited, in no part exceeds two hundred and fifty miles. but, as agrippa, including its deserts, makes it from cyrenaica, a part of it, to the country of the garamantes, so far as was then known, a further distance of nine hundred and ten miles, the entire length, added together, will make a distance of four thousand six hundred and eight miles. the length of asia is generally admitted to be six thousand three hundred and seventy-five miles, and the breadth, which ought, properly, to be reckoned from the aethiopian sea to alexandria, near the river nile, so as to run through meroe and syene, is eighteen hundred and seventy-five. it appears then that europe is greater than asia, by a little less than one half of asia, and greater than africa by as much again of africa and one-sixth. if all these sums are added together, it will be clearly seen that europe is one-third, and a little more than one-eighth part of one-third, asia one-fourth and one-fourteenth part of one-fourth, and africa, one-fifth and one-sixtieth part of one-fifth of the whole earth.
