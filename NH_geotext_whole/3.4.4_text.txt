next comes the district of cossetania, the river subi, and the colony of tarraco, which was built by the scipios as carthage was by the carthaginians. then the district of the ilergetes, the town of subur, and the river rubricatum, beyond which begin the laletani and the indigetes. behind these, in the order in which they will be mentioned, going back from the foot of the pyrenees, are the ausetani, the lacetani, and along the pyrenees, the cerretani, next to whom are the vascones. on the coast is the colony of barcino, surnamed faventia; baetulo and iluro, towns with roman citizens; the river larnum, blandae, the river alba; emporiae, a city consisting of two parts, one peopled by the original inhabitants, the other by the greek descendants of the phocaeans; and the river ticher. from this to the venus pyrenaea, on the other side of the promontory, is a distance of forty miles.
