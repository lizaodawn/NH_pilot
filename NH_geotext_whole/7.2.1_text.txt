we have pointed out that some scythian tribes, and in fact a good many, feed on human bodies - a statement that perhaps may seem incredible if we do not reflect that races of this portentous character have existed in the central region of the world, named cyclopes and laestrygones, and that quite recently the tribes of the parts beyond the alps habitually practised human sacrifice, which is not far removed from eating human flesh. but also a tribe is reported next to these, towards the north, not far from the actual quarter whence the north wind rises and the cave that bears its name, the place called the earth's doorbolt - the arimaspi whom we have spoken of already, people remarkable for having one eye in the centre of the forehead. many authorities, the most distinguished being herodotus and aristeas of proconnesus, write that these people wage continual war around their mines with the griffins, a kind of wild beast with wings, as commonly reported, that digs gold out of mines, which the creatures guard and the arimaspi try to take from them, both with remarkable covetousness.
