some trees are rendered barren by a fault in the locality, for instance the forest of cende on paros, which bears nothing; and the peach-trees on rhodes only produce blossom. this peculiarity is also caused by sex, as in the kinds of trees of which the males do not bear; though some people reverse this and assert that it is the male trees that bear. another cause of barrenness is thick growth of leaves.
