in these districts, the comini, the tadiates, the caedici, and the alfaterni, tribes of the aequiculi, have disappeared. from gellianus we learn that archippe, a town of the marsi, built by marsyas, a chieftain of the lydians, has been swallowed up by lake fucinus, and valerianus informs us that the town of the viticini in picenum was destroyed by the romans. the sabini (called, according to some writers, from their attention to religious observances and the worship of the gods, sevini) dwell on the dew-clad hills in the vicinity of the lakes of the velinus. the nar, with its sulphureous waters, exhausts these lakes, and, descending from mount fiscellus, unites with them near the groves of vacuna and reate, and then directs its course towards the tiber, into which it discharges itself. again, in another direction, the anio, taking its rise in the mountain of the trebani, carries into the tiber the waters of three lakes remarkable for their picturesque beauty, and to which sublaqueum is indebted for its name. in the territory of reate is the lake of cutiliae, in which there is a floating island, and which, according to m. varro, is the navel or central point of italy. below the sabine territory lies that of latium, on one side picenum, and behind it umbria, while the range of the apennines flanks it on either side.
