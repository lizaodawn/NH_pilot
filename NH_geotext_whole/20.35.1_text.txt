of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is cyma, although it is thought to be unwholesome, being difficult of digestion and bad for the kidneys. further, we must not forget that the water in which it has been boiled, though praised for its many uses, has a foul smell when poured out on the ground. the ash of dried cabbage-stalks is understood to be caustic, and with stale grease is used for sciatica, but with silphium and vinegar, applied as a depilatory, it prevents the growth of other hair in place of that pulled out. it is also taken lukewarm in oil, or boiled in water by itself, for convulsions, internal ruptures, and falls from a height. has cabbage then no faults to be charged with? nay, we find in the same authors that it makes the breath foul and harms teeth and gums. in egypt too, because of its bitterness, it is not eaten.
