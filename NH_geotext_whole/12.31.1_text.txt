nor is there agreement in regard to the appearance of the incense-tree itself. we have carried on operations in arabia, and the arms of rome have penetrated into a large part of it; indeed, gaius caesar, son of augustus, won great renown from the country; yet no latin writer, so far as i know, has described the appearance of this tree. the descriptions given by the greeks vary: some have stated that it has the leaf of a pear-tree, only smaller and of a grass-green colour; others that it resembles the mastich and has a reddish leaf; some that it is a kind of terebinth, and that this was the view of king antigonus, to whom a plant was brought. king juba in his volumes dedicated to gaius caesar, son of augustus, whose imagination was fired by the fame of arabia, states that the tree has a twisted stem and branches closely resembling those of the pontic maple and that it gives a juice like that of the almond; he says that trees of this description are to be seen in carmania and in egypt, where they were introduced under the influence of the ptolemies when they reigned there. it is well known that it has the bark of a bay-tree, and some have said that the leaf is also like that of the bay; at all events that was the case with the tree when it was grown at sardis - for the kings of asia also interested themselves in planting it. the ambassadors who have come to rome from arabia in my time have made all these matters still more uncertain, which may well surprise us, seeing that even some sprigs of the incense-tree find their way to rome, on the evidence of which we may believe that the parent tree also is smooth and tapering and that it puts out its shoots from a trunk that is free from knots.
