magic certainly found a home in the two gallic provinces, and that down to living memory. for the principate of tiberius caesar did away with their druids and this tribe of seers and medicine men. but why should i speak of these things when the craft has even crossed the ocean and reached the empty voids of nature? even today britain practises magic in awe, with such grand ritual that it might seem that she gave it to the persians. so universal is the cult of magic throughout the world. although its nations disagree or are unknown to each other. it is beyond calculation how great is the debt owed to the romans, who swept away the monstrous rites, in which to kill a man was the highest religious duty and for him to be eaten a passport to health.
