but very high on the list of wonders is the plant orchis, or serapias, which has the leaves of leek, a stem a span high, and a purple flower. the root has two tubers, like testicles, so that the larger, or, as some put it, the thinner, taken in water excites desire; the smaller, or softer, taken in goat's milk checks it. some say that this orchis has leaves like those of the squill, only smoother and smaller, and a prickly stem. the roots cure sores in the mouth and phlegm on the chest; taken in wine they are constipating. satyrion is a sexual stimulant. there are two kinds of it: one with longer leaves than those of the olive, a stem four fingers high, purple blossom, and a double root shaped like human testicles, which swells and subsides again in alternate years. the other kind has the further name of satyrios orehis, and is thought to be female. it is distinguished from the former kind by the spaces between the joints, by its more branchy, bushy shape, also by its root's being like a phallus. the plant is generally found near the sea.
