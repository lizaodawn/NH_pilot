the one in the campus was put to use in a remarkable way by augustus of revered memory so as to mark the sun's shadow and thereby the lengths of days and nights. a pavement was laid down for a distance appropriate to the height of the obelisk so that the shadow cast at noon on the shortest day of the year might exactly coincide with it. bronze rods let into the pavement were meant to measure the shadow day by day as it gradually became shorter and then lengthened again. this device deserves to be carefully studied, and was contrived by the mathematician novius facundus. he placed on the pinnacle a gilt ball, at the top of which the shadow would be concentrated, for otherwise the shadow cast by the tip of the obelisk would have lacked definition. he is said to have understood the principle from observing the shadow cast by the human head. the readings thus given have for about thirty years past failed to correspond to the calendar, either because the course of the sun itself is anomalous and has been altered by some change in the behaviour of the heavens or because the whole earth has shifted slightly from its central position, a phenomenon which, i hear, has been detected also in other places. or else earth-tremors in the city may have brought about a purely local displacement of the shaft or floods from the tiber may have caused the mass to settle, even though the foundations are said to have been sunk to a depth equal to the height of the load they have to carry. the third obelisk in rome stands in the vatican circus that was built by the emperors gaius and nero. it was the only one of the three that was broken during its removal. it was made by nencoreus, the son of sesosis; and there still exists another that belongs to him: it is 100 cubits in height and was dedicated by him to the sun-god in accordance with an oracle after he had been stricken with blindness and had then regained his sight.
