frankincense that hangs suspended in a globular drop we call male frankincense, although in other connexions the term 'male' is not usually employed where there is no female; but it is said to have been due to religious scruple that the name of the other sex was not employed in this case. some people think that male frankincense is so called from its resemblance to the testes. the frankincense most esteemed, however, is the breast-shaped, formed when, while a previous drop is still hanging suspended, another one following unites with it. i find it recorded that one of these lumps used to be a whole handful, in the days when men's eagerness to pluck them was less greedy and they were allowed to form more slowly. the greek name for frankincense formed in this manner is 'drop-incense' or 'solid incense,' and for the smaller kind 'chick-pea incense'; the fragments knocked off by striking the tree we call manna. even at the present day, however, drops are found that weigh as much as a third of a mina, that is 28 denarii. alexander the great in his boyhood was heaping frankincense on the altars in lavish fashion, when his tutor leonides told him that he might worship the gods in that manner when he had conquered the frankincense-producing races; but when alexander had won arabia he sent leonides a ship with a cargo of frankincense, with a message charging him to worship the gods without any stint.
