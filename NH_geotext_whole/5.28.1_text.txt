lycia: in lycia, after leaving its promontory, we come to the town of simena, mount chimaera, which sends forth flames by night, and the city of hephaestium, the heights above which are also frequently on fire. here too formerly stood the city of olympus; now we find the mountain places known as gagae, corydalla, and rhodiopolis. near the sea is limyra with a river of like name, into which the arycandus flows, mount masycites, the state of andriaca, myra, the towns of aperrae and antiphellos, formerly called habessus, and in a corner phellos, after which comes pyrrha, and then the city of xanthus, fifteen miles from the sea, as also a river known by the same name. we then come to patara, formerly pataros, and sidyma, situate on a mountain. next comes the promontory of cragus, and beyond it a gulf, equal to the one that comes before it; upon it are pinara, and telmessus, the frontier town of lycia.
