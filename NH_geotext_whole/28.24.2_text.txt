the blood of an elephant, particularly that of the male, checks all the fluxes that are called rheumatismi. ivory shavings with attic honey are said to remove dark spots on the face, and ivory dust whitlows. by the touch of the trunk headache is relieved, more successfully if the animal also sneezes. the right side of the trunk used as an amulet with the red earth of lemnos is aphrodisiac. the blood too is good for consumption, and the liver for epilepsy.
