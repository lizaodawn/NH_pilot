the proper blend for making statues is as follows, and the same for tablets: at the outset the ore is melted, and then there is added to the melted metal a third part of scrap copper, that is copper or bronze that has been bought up after use. this contains a peculiar seasoned quality of brilliance that has been subdued by friction and so to speak tamed by habitual use. silver-lead is also mixed with it in the proportion of twelve and a half pounds to every hundred pounds of the fused metal. there is also in addition what is called the mould-blend of bronze of a very delicate consistency, because a tenth part of black lead is added and a twentieth of silver-lead; and this is the best way to give it the colour called graecanic. the last kind is that called pot-bronze, taking its name from the vessels made of it; it is a blend of three or four pounds of silver-lead with every hundred pounds of copper. the addition of lead to cyprus copper produces the purple colour seen in the bordered robes of statues.
