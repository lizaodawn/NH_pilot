at perperena is a spring that turns to stone whatever land it irrigates, as do also the hot waters at aedepsus in euboea, for, whatever rocks the stream reaches increase in height. at eurymenae chaplets, thrown into a spring, turn to stone. at colossae is a river, and bricks when cast into it are of stone when taken out. in scyros in the mine all the trees watered by the river are turned to rock, branches and all. drops too dripping from the stone harden in certain caves, and hence these are concave in shape. but at mieza in macedonia the drops actually hang from the arched roofs, while in the corinthian cave they petrify after falling; in certain caverns the stone forms in both ways and makes pillars, as at phausia in the chersonesus opposite to rhodes in a huge cave, where the pillars are actually of different colours to look at. these examples must be enough for the present.
