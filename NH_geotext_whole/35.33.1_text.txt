one folly of our generation also in the matter of painting i will not leave out. the emperor nero had ordered his portrait to be painted on a colossal scale, on linen 120 ft. high, a thing unknown hitherto; this picture when finished, in the gardens of maius, was struck by lightning and destroyed by fire, together with the best part of the gardens. when a freedman of nero was giving at antium a gladiatorial show, the public porticoes were covered with paintings, so we are told, containing life-like portraits of all the gladiators and assistants. this portraiture of gladiators has been the highest interest in art for many generations now; but it was gaius terentius lucanus who began the practice of having pictures made of gladiatorial shows and exhibited in public; in honour of his grandfather who had adopted him he provided thirty pairs of gladiators in the forum for three consecutive days, and exhibited a picture of their matches in the grove of diana.
