consequently inhabitants of the east do not perceive evening eclipses of the sun and moon, nor do those dwelling in the west see morning eclipses, while the latter see eclipses at midday later than we do. the victory of alexander the great is said to have caused an eclipse of the moon at arbela at 8 p.m. while the same eclipse in sicily was when the moon was just rising. an eclipse of the sun that occurred on april 30 in the consulship [59 ad] of vipstanus and fonteius a few years ago was visible in campania between 1 and 2 p.m. but was reported by corbulo commanding in armenia as observed between 4 and 5: this was because the curve of the globe discloses and hides different phenomena for different localities. if the earth were flat, all would be visible to all alike at the same time; also the nights would not vary in length, because corresponding periods of 12 hours would be visible equally to others than those at the equator, periods that as it is do not exactly correspond in every region alike.
