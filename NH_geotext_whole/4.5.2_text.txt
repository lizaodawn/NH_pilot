upon the middle of this intervening neck which we have called the isthmus, stands the colony of corinth, formerly known by the name of ephyre, situate upon the brow of a hill, at a distance of sixty stadia from the shore of either sea. from the heights of its citadel, which is called acrocorinthus, or the "heights of corinth," and in which is the fountain of pirene, it looks down upon the two seas which lie in the opposite directions. from leucas to patrae upon the corinthian gulf is a distance of eighty-eight miles. the colony of patrae is founded upon the most extensive promontory of the peloponnesus, facing aitolia and the river evenus, the corinthian gulf being, as we have previously stated, less than a mile in width at the entrance there, though extending in length as far as the isthmus, a distance of eighty-five miles.
