the other side of thrace now begins, on the coast of the euxine, where the river ister discharges itself; and it is in this quarter perhaps that thrace possesses the finest cities, histropolis, namely, founded by the milesians, tomi, and callatis, formerly called acervetis. it also had the cities of heraclea and bizone, which latter was swallowed up by an earthquake; it now has dionysopolis, formerly called cruni, which is washed by the river zyras. all this country was formerly possessed by the scythians, surnamed aroteres; their towns were, aphrodisias, libistos, zygere, rocobe, eumenia, parthenopolis, and gerania, where a nation of pigmies is said to have dwelt; the barbarians used to call them cattuzi, and entertain a belief that they were put to flight by cranes. upon the coast, proceeding from dionysopolis, is odessus, a city of the milesians, the river panysus, and the town of tetranaulochus. mount haemus, which, with its vast chain, overhangs the euxine, had in former times upon its summit the town of aristaion. at the present day there are upon the coast mesembria, and anchialum, where messa formerly stood. the region of astice formerly had a town called anthium; at the present day apollonia occupies its site. the rivers here are the panisos, the riras, the tearus, and the orosines; there are also the towns of thynias, halmydessos, develton, with its lake, now known as deultum, a colony of veterans, and phinopolis, near which last is the bosporus. from the mouth of the ister to the entrance of the euxine, some writers have made to be a distance of 555 miles; agrippa, however, increases the length by sixty miles. the distance thence to macron tichos, or the long wall, previously mentioned, is 150 miles; and, from it to the extremity of the chersonesus, 125.
