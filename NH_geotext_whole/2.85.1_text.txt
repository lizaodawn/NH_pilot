i find in the books of the lore of etruria that once a vast and portentous earthquake occurred in the district of modena; this was during the consulship of lucius marcius and sextus julius. two mountains ran together with a mighty crash, leaping forward and then retiring with flames and smoke rising between them to the sky; this took place in the daytime, and was watched from the aemilian road by a large crowd of knights of rome with their retinues and passers by. the shock brought down all the country houses, and a great many animals in the buildings were killed. it was in the year before the allies' war, which was perhaps more disastrous to the land of italy than the civil wars. our generation also experienced a not less marvellous manifestation in the last year of the emperor nero, as we have set forth in our history of his principate: meadows and olive trees with a public road running between then got over to the opposite sides of the road; this took place in the marrucinian territory, on the lands of vettius marcellus, knight of rome, nero's estate-manager.
