the liver is on the right hand side; it contains what is called the head of the internal organs, which varies a great deal. marcus marcellus, near the time of his death, when he was killed by hannibal, found the liver missing among the organs, but on the following day a double liver was discovered. the liver was also missing with gaius marius when he offered sacrifice at utica, and also with the emperor gaius on january 1 at the commencement of his consulship in the year of his murder, and with his successor claudius in the month in which he was poisoned. when the late lamented augustus was sacrificing at spoleto on the first day he was in power the livers of six victims were found with the bottom of their tissue folded back inward, and this was interpreted to mean that he would double his power within a year. it is also of gloomy omen when the head of the liver is accidentally cut - except at a period of trouble and alarm, when it removes anxieties. hares with two livers are found in the district of briletum and thames and in the chersonese on the propontis, and surprising to say, when the animals are moved to another place one of the two livers disappears.
