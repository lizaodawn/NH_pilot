islands of the ionian sea and the adriatic: in the ausonian sea there are no islands worthy of notice beyond those which we have already mentioned, and only a few in the ionian; those, for instance, upon the calabrian coast, opposite brundusium, by the projection of which a harbour is formed; and, over against the apulian coast, diomedia, remarkable for the monument of diomedes, and another island called by the same name, but by some teutria.
