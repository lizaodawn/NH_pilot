with the mention of gold and silver goes a description of the stone called the touch stone, formerly according to theophrastus not usually found anywhere but in the river tmolus, but now found in various places. some people call it heraclian stone and others lydian. the pieces are of a moderate size, not exceeding four inches in length and two in breadth. the part of these pieces that has been exposed to the sun is better than the part on the ground. when experts using this touchstone, like a file, have taken with it a scraping from an ore, they can say at once how much gold it contains and how much silver or copper, to a difference of a scruple, their marvellous calculation not leading them astray.
