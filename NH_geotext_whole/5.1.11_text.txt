the province of tingitana is 170 miles in length. of the nations in this province the principal one was formerly that of the mauri, who have given to it the name of mauritania, and have been by many writers called the maurusii. this nation has been greatly weakened by the disasters of war, and is now dwindled down to a few families only. next to the mauri was formerly the nation of the massaesyli; they in a similar manner have become extinct. their country is now occupied by the gaetulian nations, the baniurae, the autololes, by far the most powerful people among them all, and the vesuni, who formerly were a part of the autololes, but have now separated from them, and, turning their steps towards the aethiopians, have formed a distinct nation of their own. this province, in the mountainous district which lies on its eastern side produces elephants, as also on the heights of mount abyla and among those elevations which, from the similarity of their height, are called the seven brothers. joining the range of abyla these mountains overlook the straits of gades. at the extremity of this chain begin the shores of the inland sea and we come to the tamuda, a navigable stream, with the site of a former town of the same name, and then the river laud, which is also navigable for vessels, the town and port of rhysaddir, and malvane, a navigable stream.
