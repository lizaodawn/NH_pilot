africa: beyond the river tusca begins the region of zeugitana, and that part which properly bears the name of africa. we here find three promontories; the white promontory, the promontory of apollo, facing sardinia, and promontory of mercury, opposite to sicily. projecting into the sea these headlands form two gulfs, the first of which bears the name of "hipponensis" from its proximity to the city called hippo dirutus, a corruption of the greek name diarrhytus, which it has received from the channels made for irrigation. adjacent to this place, but at a greater distance from the sea-shore, is theudalis, a town exempt from tribute. we then come to the promontory of apollo, and upon the second gulf, we find utica, a place enjoying the rights of roman citizens, and famous for the death of cato; the river bagrada, the place called castra cornelia, the colony of carthage, founded upon the remains of great carthage, the colony of maxula, the towns of carpi, misua, and clypea, the last a free town, on the promontory of mercury; also curubis, a free town, and neapolis.
