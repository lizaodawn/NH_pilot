glaucion grows in syria and parthia, a low plant, with tightly packed leaves, rather like those of the poppy but smaller and dirtier looking; it has a foul smell and a bitter, astringent taste. the seed, of a saffron colour, is put into a pot lined with fuller's clay and heated in an oven. then it is taken out, and a juice of the same name is extracted from it. both the juice and beaten-up leaves are used for the fluxes that fall in streams from the whole eye. there is made from it a salve called by physicians diaglaucin. it also restores a rich supply of milk if this fails. when taken for this purpose, water is the medium.
