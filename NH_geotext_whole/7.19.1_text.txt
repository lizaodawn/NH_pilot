it is stated that crassus the grandfather of crassus who fell in parthia never laughed, and was consequently called agelastus, and that likewise there have been many cases of people who never wept, and that the famous philosopher socrates always wore the same look on his countenance, never gayer and never more perturbed. this temperament sometimes develops into a kind of rigidity and a hard, unbending severity of nature, and takes away the emotions natural to humanity; persons of this sort are called 'apathetic' by the greeks, who have known many men of the kind, and among them surprising to say, chiefly founders of schools of philosophy, diogenes the cynic, pyrrho, heraclitus, timon - the last indeed going as far as to hate the whole human race. but these small peculiarities of nature are known to occur variously in many persons, for instance in the case of drusus's daughter antonia never spitting, in the poet and ex-consul pomponius never belching. persons whose bones are by nature solid, a rather rare class, are called 'horny.'
