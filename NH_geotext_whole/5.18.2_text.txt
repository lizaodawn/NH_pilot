we then come to the promontory of syria antiochia. in the interior is the free city of antiochia itself, surnamed epidaphnes, and divided by the river orontes. on the promontory is seleucia pieria, a free city. beyond it lies mount casius, a different one from the mountain of the same name which we have already mentioned. the height of this mountain is so vast, that, at the fourth watch of the night, you can see from it, in the midst of the darkness, the sun rising on the east; and thus, by merely turning round, we may at one and the same time behold both day and night. the winding road which leads to its summit is nineteen miles in length, its perpendicular height four. upon this coast there is the river orontes, which takes its rise near heliopolis, between the range of libanus and antilibanus. the towns are, rhosos, and, behind it, the gates of syria, lying in the space between the chain of the rhosian mountains and that of taurus. on the coast there is the town of myriandros, and mount amanus, upon which is the town of bomitae. this mountain separates cilicia from syria.
