the hellespont and mysia: the tide of the hellespont now begins to run with greater violence, and the sea beats against the shore, undermining with its eddies the barriers that stand in its way, until it has succeeded in separating asia from europe. at this spot is the promontory which we have already mentioned as trapeza; ten miles distant from which is the city of abydos, where the straits are only seven stadia wide; then the town of percote; lampsacus, at first called pityusa; the colony of parium, which homer calls by the name of adrastia; the town of priapos; the river aesepus; zelia; and then the propontis, that being the name given to the tract of sea where it enlarges. we then come to the river granicus, and the harbour of artace, where a town formerly stood. beyond this is an island which alexander joined to the continent, and upon which is cyzicus, a city of the milesians, which was formerly called arctonnesos, dolionis, and dindymis; above it are the heights of mount dindymus. we then come to the towns of placia, ariace, and scylace; in the rear of which places is mount olympus, known as the "mysian olympus," and the city of olympena. there are also the rivers horisius and rhyndacus, formerly called the lycus; this last river rises in lake artynias, near miletopolis, and receives the macestos, and many other streams, dividing in its course asia from bithynia.
