as to the length and duration of men's life, not only geographical position but also dates and the various fortunes allotted at birth to each individual have made it uncertain. hesiod, who first put forth some observations on this matter, placing many creatures above man in respect of longevity, fictitiously as i think, assigns nine of our lifetimes to the crow, four times a crow s life to stags, three times a stag's to ravens, and for the rest in a more fictitious style in the case of the phoenix and the nymphs. the poet anacreon attributes 150 years to arganthonius king of the tartesii, 10 years more to cinyras king of cyprus, and 200 to aegimius. theopompus gives 157 to epimenides of cnossus. hellanicus says that some members of the clan of the epii in aitolia complete 200 years, and he is supported by damastes who records that one of them, pictoreus, a man of outstanding stature and strength, even lived 300 years; ephorus records arcadian kings of 300 years; cornelius alexander says that a certain dando in illyria lived 500 years. xenophon in his coasting voyage says that a king of the island of the lutmii lived to 600, and - as though that were only a modest fabrication - that his son lived to 800. all of these exaggerations were due to ignorance of chronology, because some people made the year coincide with the summer, the winter being a second year, others marked it by the periods of the four seasons, for example the arcadians whose years were three months long, and some by the waning of the moon, as do the egyptians. consequently with them even individuals are recorded to have lived a thousand years.
