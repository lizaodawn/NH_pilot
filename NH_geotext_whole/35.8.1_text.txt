the high esteem attached officially to foreign paintings at rome originated from lucius mummius who from his victory received the surname of achaicus. at the sale of booty captured king attalus bought for 600,000 denarii a picture of father liber or dionysus by aristides, but the price surprised mummius, who suspecting there must be some merit in the picture of which he was himself unaware had the picture called back, in spite of attalus's strong protests, and placed it in the shrine of ceres: the first instance, i believe, of a foreign picture becoming state-property at rome. after this i see that they were commonly placed even in the forum: to this is due the famous witticism df the pleader crassus, when appearing in a case below the old shops; a witness called kept asking him: 'now tell me, crassus, what sort of a person do you take me to be?' 'that sort of a person,' said crassus, pointing to a picture of a gaul putting out his tongue in a very unbecoming fashion. it was also in the forum that there was the picture of the old shepherd with his staff, about which the teuton envoy when asked what he thought was the value of it said that he would rather not have even the living original as a gift!
