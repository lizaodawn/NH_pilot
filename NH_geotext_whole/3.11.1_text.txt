sixty-four islands, among which are the baleares. the first islands that we meet with in all these seas are the two to which the greeks have given the name of pityussae, from the pine-tree, which they produce. these islands now bear the name of ebusus, and form a federate state. they are separated by a narrow strait of the sea, and are forty-six miles in extent. they are distant from dianium 700 stadia, dianium being by land the same distance from new carthage. at the same distance from the pityussae, lie, in the open sea, the two baleares, and, over against the river sucro, colubraria. the baleares, so formidable in war with their slingers, have received from the greeks the name of gymnasiae.
