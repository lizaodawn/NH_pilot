between the sirops and real wine is the liquor that the greeks call aigleucos - this is our 'permanent must.' care is needed for its production, as it must not be allowed to 'boil' - that is the word they use to denote the passage of must into wine. consequently, as soon as the must is taken from the vat and put into casks, they plunge the casks in water till midwinter passes and regular cold weather sets in. there is moreover another kind of raisin-wine known in the province of narbonne, and there particularly to the vocontii, under the name of 'sweet wine.' for the purpose of this they keep the grape hanging on the vine for an exceptional time, with the foot-stalk twisted. some make an incision in the actual shoot as far as the pith and others leave the grapes to dry on tiled roofs, the grapes in all cases being those from the helvennaca vine. to these some add a wine called in greek 'strained wine,' to make which the grapes are dried in the sun for seven days raised seven feet from the ground on hurdles, in an enclosed place where at night they are protected from damp; on the eighth day they are trodden out, and this process produces a wine of extremely good bouquet and flavour. another wine of the sweet class is called honey-wine; it differs from mead because it is made from must, in the proportion of thirty pints of must of a dry quality to six pints of honey and a cup of salt, this mixture being brought just to the boil; this produces a dry-flavoured liquor. but among these varieties ought also to be placed the liquor called in greek protropam, the name given by some people to must that flows down of its own accord before the grapes are trodden. this as soon as it flows is put into special flagons and allowed to ferment, and afterwards left to dry for forty days of the summer that follows, just at the rise of the dog-star.
