in other respects egypt is of all the countries in the world the best adapted for the production of unguents, but campania with its abundance of roses runs it close. but judea is even more famous for its palm-trees, the nature of which will now be described. it is true that there are also palms in europe, and they are common in italy, but these are barren. in the coastal regions of spain they do bear fruit, but it does not ripen, and in africa the fruit is sweet but will not keep for any time. on the other hand in the east the palm supplies the native races with wine, and some of them with bread, while a very large number rely on it also for cattle fodder. for this reason, therefore, we shall be justified in describing the palms of foreign countries; there are none in italy not grown under cultivation, nor are there in any other part of the earth except where there is a warm climate, while only in really hot countries does the palm bear fruit.
