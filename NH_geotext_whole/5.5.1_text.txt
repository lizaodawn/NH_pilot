cyrenaica: the region of cyrenaica, also called pentapolis, is rendered famous by the oracle of hammon, which is distant 400 miles from the city of cyrene; also by the fountain of the sun there, and five cities in especial, those of berenice, arsinoe, ptolemais, apollonia, and cyrene itself. berenice is situate upon the outer promontory that bounds the syrtis; it was formerly called the city of the hesperides (previously mentioned), according to the fables of the greeks, which very often change their localities. not far from the city, and running before it, is the river lethon, and with it a sacred grove, where the gardens of the hesperides are said to have formerly stood; this city is distant from leptis 375 miles. from berenice to arsinoe, commonly called teuchira, is forty-three miles; after which, at a distance of twenty-two, we come to ptolemais, the ancient name of which was barce; and at a distance of forty miles from this last the promontory of phycus, which extends far away into the cretan sea, being 350 miles distant from taenarum, the promontory of laconia, and from crete 225. after passing this promontory we come to cyrene, which stands at a distance of eleven miles from the sea. from phycus to apollonia is twenty-four miles, and from thence to the chersonesus eighty-eight; from which to catabathmos is a distance of 216 miles. the marmaridae inhabit this coast, extending from almost the region of paraetonium to the greater syrtis; after them the ararauceles, and then, upon the coasts of the syrtis, the nasamones, whom the greeks formerly called mesammones, from the circumstance of their being located in the very midst of sands. the territory of cyrene, to a distance of fifteen miles from the shore, is said to abound in trees, while for the same distance beyond that district it is only suitable for the cultivation of corn: after which, a tract of land, thirty miles in breadth and 250 in length, is productive of nothing but laser [or silphium].
