allex is sediment of garum, the dregs, neither whole nor strained. it has, however, also begun to be made separately from a tiny fish, otherwise of no use. the romans call it apua, the greeks aphye, because this tiny fish is bred out of rain. the people of forum julii call lupus (wolf) the fish from which they make garum. then allex became a luxury, and its various kinds have come to be innumerable; garum for instance has been blended to the colour of old honey wine, and to a taste so pleasant that it can be drunk. but another kind of garum is devoted to superstitious sex-abstinence and jewish rites, and is made from fish without scales. thus allex has come to be made from oysters, sea urchins, sea anemones, and mullet's liver, and salt to be corrupted in numberless ways so as to suit all palates. these incidental remarks must suffice for the luxurious tastes of civilized man. allen however itself is of some use in healing. for allex both cures itch in sheep, being poured into an incision in the skin, and is a good antidote for the bites of dog or sea draco; it is applied on pieces of lint. by garum too are fresh burns healed, if it is poured over them without mentioning garum. it is also good for dog-bites and especially those of the crocodile, and for spreading or foul ulcers. for ulcers too or pains in mouth or ears it is wonderfully good. muria too or the salsugo i spoke of is astringent, biting, reducing and drying, useful for dysentery, even if there is ulceration of the bowels. it is injected for sciatica and chronic coeliac disease. among inland peoples it also takes the place of sea water for fomentations.
