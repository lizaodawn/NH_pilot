nations in the vicinity of the scythian ocean: having now stated all that bears reference to the interior of asia, let us cross in imagination the riphaean mountains, and traverse the shores of the ocean to the right. on three sides does this ocean wash the coasts of asia, as the scythian ocean on the north, the eastern ocean on the east, and the indian ocean on the south; and it is again divided into various names, derived from the numerous gulfs which it forms, and the nations which dwell upon its shores. a great part of asia, however, which lies exposed to the north, through the noxious effects of those freezing climates, consists of nothing but vast deserts. from the extreme north northeast to the point where the sun rises in the summer, it is the country of the scythians. still further than them, and beyond the point where north north-east begins, some writers have placed the hyperborei, who are said, indeed, by the majority to be a people of europe. after passing this point, the first place that is known is lytarmis, a promontory of celtica, and next to it the river carambucis, where the chain of the riphaean mountains terminates, and with it the extreme rigour of the climate; here, too, we have heard of a certain people being situate, called the arimphaei, a race not much unlike the hyperborei. their habitations are the groves, and the berries their diet; long hair is held to be disgraceful by the women as well as the men, and they are mild in their manners. hence it is that they are reported to be a sacred race, and are never molested even by the savage tribes which border upon them, and not only they, but such other persons as well as may have fled to them for refuge. beyond these we come straight to the scythians, the cimmerii, the cisianthi, the georgi, and a nation of amazons. these last extend to the caspian and hyrcanian sea.
