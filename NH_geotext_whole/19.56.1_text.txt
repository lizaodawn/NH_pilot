there remain the garden plants of the fennel-giant class, for instance fennel, which snakes are very fond of, as we have said, and which when dried is useful for seasoning a great many dishes, and thapsia, which closely resembles it, of which we have spoken among foreign bushes, and then hemp, which is exceedingly useful for ropes. hemp is sown when the spring west wind sets in; the closer it grows the thinner its stalks are. its seed when ripe is stripped off after the autumn equinox and dried in the sun or wind or by the smoke of a fire. the hemp plant itself is plucked after the vintage, and peeling and cleaning it is a task done by candle light. the best is that of arab-hissar, which is specially used for making hunting-nets. three classes of hemp are produced at that place: that nearest to the bark or the pith is considered of inferior value, while that from the middle, the greek name for which is 'middles', is most highly esteemed. the second best hemp comes from mylasa. as regards height, the hemp of rosea in the sabine territory grows as tall as a fruit-tree. the two kinds of fennel-giant have been mentioned above among exotic shrubs. in italy its seed is an article of diet; in fact it is stored in pots and lasts for as much as a year. two different parts of it are used as vegetables, the stalks and the branches. this fennel is called in greek clump-fennel, and the parts that are stored, clumps.
