male tunnies have no fin under the belly. in spring time they enter the black sea from the mediterranean in shoals, and they do not spawn anywhere else. the name of cordyla is given to the fry, which accompany the fish when they return to the sea in autumn after spawning; in the spring they begin to be called mudfish or pelamydes (from the greek for 'mud'), and when they have exceeded the period of one year they are called tunny. these fish are cut up into parts, and the neck and belly are counted a delicacy, and also the throat provided it is fresh, and even then it causes severe flatulence; all the rest of the tunny, with the flesh entire, is preserved in salt: these pieces are called melandrya, as resembling splinters of oak-wood. the cheapest of them are the parts next the tail, because they lack fat, and the parts most favoured are those next the throat; whereas in other fish the parts round the tail are most in use. at the pelamys stage they are divided into choice slices and cut up small into a sort of little cube.
