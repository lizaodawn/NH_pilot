so among the leaves used to make chaplets are found those of melotrum, spiraea, wild marjoram, cneorum, that hyginus calls cassia, conyza, which he calls cunilago, melissophyllum, known to us as apiastrum, and melilot, which we call campanian garland. for in italy the favourite kind grows in campania, in greece at sounion, next in repute the melilot of chalcidice and crete, being found however everywhere only in wild, woody districts. that chaplets were in antiquity often made from the melilot is shown by the name sertula (garland), which it has adopted as its own. the scent is near to that of saffron, and so is the flower itself. the campanian is very popular indeed, having very short and very fleshy leaves.
