although they have now ceased to be used as gems, there are certain stones to be mentioned that are called 'chrysoelectri,' or 'golden amber.' their colour passes into that of amber, but only in morning light. those from pontus are betrayed by their light weight. some of these stones are hard and reddish, while some are soft and full of flaws. bocchus assures us that they have been found also in spain, in the place where, according to his previous account, rock-crystal is dug up from shafts sunk to water-level, and adds that he saw a 'chrysolithus' weighing twelve pounds.
