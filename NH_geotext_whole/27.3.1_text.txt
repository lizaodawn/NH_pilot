aethiopis has leaves like those of phlomos, large, numerous and hairy, growing from the root. the stem is quadrangular, rough, like that of arction and hollowed by many axils. the seed is like that of vetch, white and geminate; the roots are numerous, long, fleshy, soft, and gluey to the taste. when dry these become black and hard, so that they might be taken for horns. this plant grows not only in aethiopia, but also on mount ida in the troad and in messenia. the roots are gathered in autumn and dried in the sun for some days to prevent their growing mouldy. taken in white wine they are a remedy for uterine troubles, and a decoction is given by the mouth for sciatica, pleurisy and rough throats. the aethiopian kind, however, gives the greatest, and immediate, relief.
