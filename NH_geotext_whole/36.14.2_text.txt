above all, there came also the difficult task of transporting obelisks to rome by sea. the ships used attracted much attention from sightseers. that which carried the first of two obelisks was solemnly laid up by augustus of revered memory in a permanent dock at pozzuoli to celebrate the remarkable achievement; but later it was destroyed by fire. the ship used by the emperor gaius for bringing a third was carefully preserved for several years by claudius of revered memory, for it was the most amazing thing that had ever been seen at sea. then caissons made of cement were erected in its hull at pozzuoli; whereupon it was towed to ostia and sunk there by order of the emperor, so to contribute to his harbour-works. then there is another problem, that of providing ships that can carry obelisks up the tiber; and the successful experiment shows that the river has just as deep a channel as the nile. the obelisk placed by augustus of revered memory in the circus maximus was cut by king psemetnepserphreus, who was reigning when pythagoras was in egypt, and measures 85 feet and 9 inches, apart from its base, which forms part of the same stone. the obelisk in the campus martius, however, which is 9 feet less, was cut by sesothis. both have inscriptions comprising an account of natural science according to the theories of the egyptian sages.
