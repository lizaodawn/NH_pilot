before the time of dipoenus and scyllis there had already lived in the island of chios a sculptor melas, who was succeeded by his son micciades and his grandson archermus; and the sons of archermus, named bupalus and athenis, were quite the most eminent masters of the art at the time of the poet hipponax, who is known to have been alive in the 60th olympiad. now if we trace their lineage back to the time of their great-grandfather, we find that the beginnings of this art coincide in time with the 1st olympiad. hipponax had a notoriously ugly face; and because of this they made impudent jokes much to the amusement of the groups of companions to whom they exhibited his likeness. this angered hipponax, who rebuked them so violently in his mordant lampoons that he is believed by some to have driven them to hang themselves. but this is untrue because later they made several statues in neighbouring islands, for example in delos; and to their pedestals they attached verses to the effect that 'chios is esteemed not merely for its vines, but also for the works of the sons of archermus.' moreover the people of iasos proudly display a diana made by them. in chios itself there is stated to be a face of diana which is their work. it is set in a lofty position, and people entering the building imagine that her expression is stern, but when they leave they fancy that it has become cheerful. at rome there are statues by them on the angles of the pediment of the temple of apollo on the palatine and on almost all the buildings for which the emperor augustus of revered memory was responsible. there were works by their father too at delos and in the island of lesbos. as for dipoenus, ambracia, argos and kleonai were full of his productions.
