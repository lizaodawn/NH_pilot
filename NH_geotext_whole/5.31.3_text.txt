after leaving ephesus there is another mantium, belonging to the colophonians, and in the interior colophon itself, past which the river halesus flows. after this we come to the temple of the clarian apollo, and lebedos: the city of notium once stood here. next comes the promontory of coryceium, and then mount mimas, which projects 150 miles into the sea, and as it approaches the mainland sinks down into extensive plains. it was at this place that alexander the great gave orders for the plain to be cut through, a distance of seven miles and a half, for the purpose of joining the two gulfs and making an island of erythrae and mimas. near erythrae formerly stood the towns of pteleon, helos, and dorion; we now find the river aleon, corynaion, a promontory of mount mimas, clazomenae, parthenie, and hippi, known by the name of chytrophoria, when it formed a group of islands; these were united to the continent by the same alexander, by means of a causeway two stadia in length. in the interior, the cities of daphnus, hermesia, and sipylum, formerly called tantalis, and the capital of maeonia, where lake sale now stands, are now no longer in existence: archaeopolis too, which succeeded sipylum, has perished, and in their turns colpe and libade, which succeeded it.
