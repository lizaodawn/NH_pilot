the fortunate islands: there are some authors who think that beyond these are the fortunate islands, and some others; the number of which sebosus gives, as well as the distances, informing us that junonia is an island seven hundred and fifty miles distant from gades. he states also that pluvialia and capraria are the same distance from junonia, to the west; and that in pluvialia the only fresh water to be obtained is rain water. he then states that at a distance of two hundred and fifty miles from these, opposite the left of mauritania, and situate in the direction of the sun at the eighth hour, are the fortunate islands, one of which, from its undulating surface, has the name of invallis, and another that of planasia, from the peculiarity of its appearance. he states also that the circumference of invallis is three hundred miles, and that trees grow to a height of one hundred and fourteen feet.
