heracleopolites is a nome on an island of the nile, fifty miles in length, upon which there is a city, called the 'city of hercules.' there are two places called arsinoites: these and memphites extend to the apex of the delta; adjoining to which, on the side of africa, are the two nomes of oasite. some writers vary in some of these names and substitute for them other nomes, such as heroopolites and crocodilopolites. between arsinoites and memphites, a lake, 250 miles, or, according to what mucianus says, 450 miles in circumference and fifty paces deep, has been formed by artificial means: after the king by whose orders it was made, it is called by the name of moeris. the distance from thence to memphis is nearly sixty-two miles, a place which was formerly the citadel of the kings of egypt; from thence to the oracle of hammon it is twelve days' journey. memphis is fifteen miles from the spot where the river nile divides into the different channels which we have mentioned as forming the delta.
