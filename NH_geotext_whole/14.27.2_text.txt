flower of wine forming is thought to be a good sign if it is white, but a bad sign if it is red, unless it is a red wine; similarly it is a bad sign if the jars feel warm to the touch, or if the lids sweat. wine that quickly begins to form a flower and to develop an odour is not going to keep. also boiled-down must and must of new wine should be boiled when there is no moon, which means at the conjunction of that planet, and not on any other day; and moreover leaden and not copper jars should be used, and some walnuts should be thrown into the liquor, for those are said to absorb the smoke. the best way of treating the finest wines of campania seems to be to set them out in casks in the open air, exposed to the sun, moon, rain and wind.
