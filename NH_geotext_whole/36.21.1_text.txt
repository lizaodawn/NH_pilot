of grandeur as conceived by the greeks a real and remarkable example still survives, namely the temple of diana at ephesus, the building of which occupied all asia minor for 120 years. it was built on marshy soil so that it might not be subject to earthquakes or be threatened by subsidences. on the other hand, to ensure that the foundations of so massive a building would not be laid on shifting, unstable ground, they were underpinned with a layer of closely trodden charcoal, and then with another of sheepskins with their fleeces unshorn. the length of the temple overall is 425 feet, and its breadth 225 feet. there are 127 columns, each constructed by a different king and 60 feet in height. of these, 36 were carved with reliefs, one of them by scopas. the architect in charge of the work was chersiphron. the crowning marvel was his success in lifting the architraves of this massive building into place. this he achieved by filling bags of plaited reed with sand and constructing a gently graded ramp which reached the upper surfaces of the capitals of the columns. then, little by little, he emptied the lowest layer of bags, so that the fabric gradually settled into its right position. but the greatest difficulty was encountered with the lintel itself when he was trying to place it over the door; for this was the largest block, and it would not settle on its bed. the architect was in anguish as he debated whether suicide should be his final decision. the story goes that in the course of his reflections he became weary, and that while he slept at night he saw before him the goddess for whom the temple was being built: she was urging him to live because, as she said, she herself had laid the stone. and on the next day this was seen to be the case. the stone appeared to have been adjusted merely by dint of its own weight. the other embellishments of the building are enough to fill many volumes, since they are in no way related to natural forms.
