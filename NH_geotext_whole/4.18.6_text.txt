at this spot there is another isthmus, similar in name to the other, and of about equal width; and, in a manner by no means dissimilar, two cities formerly stood on the shore, one on either side, pactye on the side of the propontis, and cardia on that of the gulf of melas, the latter deriving its name from the shape which the land assumes. these, however, were afterwards united with lysimachia, which stands at a distance of five miles from macron tichos. the chersonesus formerly had, on the side of the propontis, the towns of tiristasis, crithotes, and cissa, on the banks of the river aegos; it now has, at a distance of twenty-two miles from the colony of apros, resistos, which stands opposite to the colony of parium. the hellespont also, which separates, as we have already stated, europe from asia, by a channel seven stadia in width, has four cities facing each other, callipolis and sestos in europe, and lampsacus and abydos in asia. on the chersonesus, there is the promontory of mastusia, lying opposite to sigeum; upon one side of it stands the cynossema (for so the tomb of hecuba is called), the naval station of the achaeans, and a tower; and near it the shrine of protesilaus. on the extreme front of the chersonesus, which is called aeolium, there is the city of elaeus. advancing thence towards the gulf of melas, we have the port of coelos, panormus, and then cardia, previously mentioned.
