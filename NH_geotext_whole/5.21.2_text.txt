palmyra is a city famous for the beauty of its site, the riches of its soil, and the delicious quality and abundance of its water. its fields are surrounded by sands on every side, and are thus separated, as it were, by nature from the rest of the world. though placed between the two great empires of rome and parthia, it still maintains its independence; never failing, at the very first moment that a rupture between them is threatened, to attract the careful attention of both. it is distant 337 miles from seleucia of the parthians, generally known as seleucia on the tigris, 203 from the nearest part of the syrian coast, and twenty-seven less from damascus.
