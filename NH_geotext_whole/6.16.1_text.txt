adiabene: the kingdom of the persians, by which we now understand that of parthia, is elevated upon the caucasian chain between two seas, the persian and the hyrcanian. to the greater armenia, which in the front slopes towards commagene, is joined sophene, which lies upon the descent on both sides thereof, and next to it is adiabene, the most advanced frontier of assyria; a part of which is arbelitis, he alludes to the town of arbela, where, as it is generally said, the army of darius was defeated by alexander the great; by which engagement the conflict was terminated. it was the fact, however, that darius left his baggage and treasures at arbela, while the battle really took place near the village of gaugamela, about twenty miles to the north-west of arbela. this place still retains its name of arbil, where alexander conquered darius, and which joins up to syria. the whole of this country was called mygdonia by the macedonians, on account of the resemblance it bore to mygdonia in europe. its cities are alexandria, and antiochia, also called nisibis; this last place is distant from artaxata seven hundred and fifty miles. there was also in former times ninus, a most renowned city, on the banks of the tigris, with an aspect towards the west. adjoining the other front of greater armenia, which runs down towards the caspian sea, we find atropatene, which is separated from otene, a region of armenia, by the river araxes; gazae is its chief city, distant from artaxata four hundred and fifty miles, and the same from ecbatana in media, to which country atropatene belongs.
