teucer too in the same age discovered teucrion, called by some hemionion; it spreads out thin, rush-like twigs with small leaves, grows on rough localities, has a harsh taste, never flowers and never produces seed. it is a cure for splenic troubles, a property discovered, as is well known, in the following way; they say that when sacrificial entrails had been thrown on the plant, this stuck to the spleen and consumed it. on account of this the plant is called by some splenion. it is said that pigs which eat its root are found to be without a spleen. there are some who call by the same name a ligneous plant with branches like those of hyssop and leaves like those of the bean, and recommend it to be gathered when it is in flower - so these certainly hold that the plant has a flower - and they praise most highly the sort that comes from the mountains of cilicia and pisidia.
