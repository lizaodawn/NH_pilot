some colours are sombre and some brilliant, the difference being due to the nature of the substances or to their mixture. the brilliant colours, which the patron supplies at his own expense to the painter, are cinnabar, armenium, dragon's blood, gold-solder, indigo, bright purple; the rest are sombre. of the whole list some are natural colours and some artificial. natural colours are sinopis, ruddle, paraetonium, melinum, eretrian earth and orpiment; all the rest are artificial, and first of all those which we specified among minerals, and moreover among the commoner kinds yellow ochre, burnt lead acetate, realgar, sandyx, syrian colour and black.
