i wonder that homer made no mention of hot springs, and that though he frequently speaks of hot baths, the reason being that modern hydropathie treatment was not then a part of medicine. sulphur waters, however, are good for the sinews, alum waters for paralysis and similar cases of collapse, waters containing bitumen and soda, such as that of cutilia, are good for drinking and as a purge. many people make a matter of boasting the great number of hours they can endure the heat of these sulphur waters - a very injurious practice, for one should remain in them a little longer than in the bath, afterwards rinse in cool, fresh water, and not go away without a rubbing with oil. the common people find these details irksome, and so there is no greater risk to health than this treatment, because an overpowering smell goes to the head, which sweats and is seized with chill, while the rest of the body is immersed. those make a like mistake who boast of the great quantity they can drink. i have seen some already swollen with drinking to such an extent that their rings were covered by skin, since they could not void the vast amount of water they had swallowed. so it is not good to drink these waters without a frequent taste of salt. the mud too of medicinal springs is used with advantage, but the application should be dried in the sun. we must not think, however, that all hot waters are medicinal; for there are those at segesta in sicily, at larisa in the troad, at magnesia, in melos and lipara. nor is the discoloration of bronze or silver a proof, as many have thought, of medicinal properties, since there are none in the springs of patavium. between medicinal and other water there is not even a difference of smell to be detected.
