these are the names of places given as far as meroe: but at the present day hardly any of them on either side of the river are in existence; at all events, the praetorian troops that were sent by the emperor nero under the command of a tribune, for the purposes of enquiry, when, among his other wars, he was contemplating an expedition against aethiopia, brought back word that they had met with nothing but deserts on their route. the roman arms also penetrated into these regions in the time of the late emperor augustus, under the command of p. petronius, a man of equestrian rank, and prefect of egypt. that general took the following cities, the only ones we now find mentioned there, in the following order; pselcis, primis, abuncis, phthuris, cambusis, atteva, and stadasis, where the river nile, as it thunders down the precipices, has quite deprived the inhabitants of the power of hearing: he also sacked the town of napata. the extreme distance to which he penetrated beyond syene was nine hundred and seventy miles; but still, it was not the roman arms that rendered these regions a desert. aethiopia, in its turn gaining the mastery, and then again reduced to servitude, was at last worn out by its continual wars with egypt, having been a famous and powerful country even at the time of the trojan war, when memnon was its king; it is also very evident from the fabulous stories about andromeda, that it ruled over syria in the time of king cepheus, and that its sway extended as far as the shores of our sea.
