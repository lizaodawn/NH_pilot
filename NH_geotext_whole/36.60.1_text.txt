paved floors originated among the greeks and were skilfully embellished with a kind of paint-work until this was superseded by mosaics. in this latter field the most famous exponent was sosus, who at pergamum laid the floor of what is known in greek as 'the unswept room' because, by means of small cubes tinted in various shades, he represented on the floor refuse from the dinner table and other sweepings, making them appear as if they had been left there. a remarkable detail in the picture is a dove, which is drinking and casts the shadow of its head on the water, while others are sunning and preening themselves on the brim of a large drinking vessel.
