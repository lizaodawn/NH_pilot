lucius piso has recorded that, in the second consulship of marcus aemilius and gaius popilius, the censors publius cornelius scipio and marcus popilius caused all the statues round the forum of men who had held office as magistrates to be removed excepting those that had been set up by a resolution of the people or the senate, while the statue which spurius cassius, who had aspired to monarchy, had erected in his own honour before the temple of tellus was actually melted down by censors: obviously the men of those days took precautions against ambition in the matter of statues also. some declamatory utterances made by cato during his censorship are extant protesting against the erection in the roman provinces of statues to women; yet all the same he was powerless to prevent this being done at rome also: for instance there is the statue of cornelia the mother of the gracchi and daughter of the elder scipio africanus. this represents her in a sitting position and is remarkable because there are no straps to the shoes; it stood in the public colonnade of metellus, but is now in octavia's works.
