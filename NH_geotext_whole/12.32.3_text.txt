frankincense after being collected is conveyed to sabota on camels, one of the gates of the city being opened for its admission; the kings have made it a capital offence for camels so laden to turn aside from the high road. at sahota a tithe estimated by measure and not by weight is taken by the priests for the god they call sabis, and the incense is not allowed to be put on the market until this has been done; this tithe is drawn on to defray what is a public expenditure, for actually on a fixed number of days the god graciously entertains guests at a banquet. it can only be exported through the country of the gebbanitae, and accordingly a tax is paid on it to the king of that people as well. their capital is thomna, which is 1487 1/2 miles distant from the town of gaza in judea on the mediterranean coast; the journey is divided into 65 stages with halts for camels. fixed portions of the frankincense are also given to the priests and the king's secretaries, but beside these the guards and their attendants and the gate-keepers and servants also have their pickings: indeed all along the route they keep on paying, at one place for water, at another for fodder, or the charges for lodging at the halts, and the various octrois; so that expenses mount up to 688 denarii per camel before the mediterranean coast is reached; and then again payment is made to the customs officers of our empire. consequently the price of the best frankincense is 6, of the second best 5, and the third best 3 denarii a pound. it is tested by its whiteness and stickiness, its fragility and its readiness to catch fire from a hot coal; and also it should not give to pressure of the teeth, and should rather crumble into grains. among us it is adulterated with drops of white resin, which closely resemble it, but the fraud can be detected by the means specified.
