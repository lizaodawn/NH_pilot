however, to return to products pure and simple, the most costly product of the sea is the pearl; of the earth's surface, rock-crystal; of the earth's interior, diamonds, emeralds, gemstones and vessels of fluorspar; of the earth's increase, the scarlet kermes-insect and silphium, with spikenard and silks from leaves, citrus wood from trees, cinnamon, cassia and amomum from shrubs, amber, balsam, myrrh and frankincense, which exude from trees or shrubs, and costus from roots. as for those animals which are equipped to breathe, the most costly product found on land is the elephant's tusk, and on sea the turtle's shell. of the hides and coats of animals, the most costly are the pelts dyed in china and the arabian she-goat's tufted beard which we call 'ladanum.' of creatures that belong to both land and sea, the most costly products are scarlet and purple dyes made from shell-fish. birds are credited with no outstanding contribution except warriors' plumes and the grease of the commagene goose. we must not forget to mention that gold, for which all mankind has so mad a passion, comes scarcely tenth in the list of valuables, while silver, with which we purchase gold, is almost as low as twentieth. hail, nature, mother of all creation, and mindful that i alone of the men of rome have praised thee in all thy manifestations, be gracious unto me.
