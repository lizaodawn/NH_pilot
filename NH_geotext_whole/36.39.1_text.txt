eagle stones have acquired a reputation owing to the associations aroused by the term. as i have already stated in book x, they are found in eagles' nests. it is said that they are found in pairs, a male and a female, and that without them the eagles in question cannot produce young: hence there is only a pair of stones. there are four kinds of eagle stones. one kind found in africa is small and soft, and carries inside it, as though in a womb, a pleasing white clay. the stone itself is liable to crumble and is considered to be female, while a kind that occurs in arabia and is hard, coloured like an oak gall or else reddish in appearance and containing a hard stone in its hollow centre, is regarded as a male. a third kind found in cyprus is similar in colour to those of africa, but is larger and elongated, the shape of all other kinds being spherical. it carries inside it an agreeable kind of sand and small nodules, while the stone itself is soft enough to be crumbled merely with one's fingers. the fourth kind, known as the taphiusian, occurs not far from the island of leucas in taphiusa, a district that lies to the right as one sails to leucas from ithaca. it is found as a white, round stone in streams. in its hollow centre is a stone known as the 'callimus,' but no trace of earthy matter. eagle stones, wrapped in the skins of animals that have been sacrificed, are worn as amulets by women or four-footed creatures during pregnancy so as to prevent a miscarriage. they must not be removed except at the moment of delivery: otherwise, there will be a prolapse of the uterus. on the other hand, if they were not removed during delivery no birth would take place.
