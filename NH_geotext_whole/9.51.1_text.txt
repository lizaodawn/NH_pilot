the kinds of crab are the carabus, the crayfish, the spider-crab, the hermit-crab, the heraclean crab, the lion-crab and other inferior species. the carabus differs from the other crabs by its tail; in phoenicia it is called the horse-crab, being so swift that it is impossible to overtake it. crabs are long-lived. they have eight feet, all curved crooked; the front foot is double in the female and single in the male. they also have two claws with denticulated nippers; the upper half of the forepart of these moves and the lower half is fixed. the right claw is the larger in every specimen. sometimes crabs all collect together in a flock. they cannot make the mouth of the black sea against the current, and consequently when they are going out of it they travel round in a circle and appear to be following a beaten track. the one called the pea-crab is the smallest of the whole tribe, and consequently very liable to injury. it has the cunning to stow itself in empty bivalve shells and to shift into roomier ones as it grows bigger. when alarmed crabs can retreat backwards with equal speed. they fight duels with one another like rams; charging with horns opposed. they afford a remedy against snake-bite. it is related that when the sun is passing through the sign of cancer the bodies of crabs also when they expire are transformed into scorpions during the drought.
