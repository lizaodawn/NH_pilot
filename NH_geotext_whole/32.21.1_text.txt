the same poisons are counteracted also by oysters. about these it cannot appear that enough has been said, seeing that they have long been considered the prize delicacy of our tables. oysters love fresh water, and where there is an inflow from many rivers; wherefore deep-sea oysters are small and far between. they also breed, however, in rocky districts and places where no fresh water in comes, such as around grynium and myrina. their growth corresponds very closely to the increase of the moon, as i said a when dealing with water-creatures, but they grow most about the beginning of summer, and where sunshine makes its way into shallows, for then they swell with copious, milky, juice. this appears to be the reason why oysters found in deep water are rather small; darkness hinders their growth, and their gloom robs them of appetite.
