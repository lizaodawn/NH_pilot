among the remaining wines there are, in the vicinity of the adriatic and ionian sea, the praetutian and those grown at ancona and the vines called sprig-vines, because they were all struck from a single chance sprig; and in the interior the wines of cezena and those called by the name of maecenas; also in the district of verona the raetian, reckoned by virgil inferior only to falernian; and next at the top of the adriatic the wines of adria, and from the lower sea the latiniensian, graviscan and statoniensian. luna carries off the palm of etruria and genoa that of liguria. between the pyrenees and the alps marseilles has wine of two flavours, as it produces a richer variety, the local name for which is the 'juicy' brand, which is also used for seasoning other wines. the importance of the wine of beterrae does not extend outside the gallic provinces; and about the rest of the wines grown in the province of narbonne no positive statement can be made, inasmuch as the dealers have set up a regular factory for the purpose and colour them by means of smoke, and i regret to say also by employing noxious herbs and drugs - inasmuch as a dealer actually uses aloe for adulterating the flavour and the colour of his wines.
