after those and before the 90th olympiad there were other celebrated painters also, such as polygnotus of thasos who first represented women in transparent draperies and showed their heads and covered with a parti-coloured headdress; and he first contributed many improvements to the art of painting, as he introduced showing the mouth wide open and displaying the teeth and giving expression to the countenance in place of the primitive rigidity. there is a picture by this artist in the portico of pompeius which formerly hung in front of the curia which he built, in which it is doubtful whether the figure of a man with a shield is painted as going up or as coming down. polygnotus painted the temple at delphi and the colonnade at athens called painted portico, doing his work gratuitously, although a part of the work was painted by micon who received a fee. indeed polygnotus was held in higher esteem, as the amphictyones, who are a general council of greece, voted him entertainment at the public expense. there was also another micon, distinguished from the first by the surname of the younger, whose daughter timarete also painted.
