the art of cutting marble into thin slabs may possibly have been invented in caria. the earliest instance, so far as i can discover, is that of the palace of mausolus at halicarnassus, the brick walls of which were decorated with proconnesian marble. he died in the second year of the 107th olympiad and in the 403rd year after the founding of rome.
