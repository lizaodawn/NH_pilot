the best silexa is the black variety, although in certain localities it is the red that is best, and in several places even the white, as in the anician quarries round lake bolsena near trachina or, again, in the neighbourhood of statonia, the stone from these two places being immune even to fire. the same two varieties are, moreover, used for sculpture on monuments, where they offer the added advantage of remaining untouched by the ravages of time. of these stones are made the moulds in which bronze implements are cast. there is also a green stone that strongly resists fire, but it is nowhere plentiful and, where it is found, occurs in pieces and not in a mass. of the remaining varieties, the pale silex can only occasionally be used for rough walling, while the rounded kind stands up to hard abuse, but is unreliable for building purposes unless it is bonded with large quantities of mortar. the silex found in rivers is no more reliable, always giving the impression of being thoroughly damp.
