this was the old method of producing glass. now, however, in italy too a white sand which forms in the river volturnus is found along 6 miles of the seashore between cuma and literno. wherever it is softest, it is taken to be ground in a mortar or mill. then it is mixed with three parts of soda, either by weight or by measure, and after being fused is taken in its molten state to other furnaces. there it forms a lump known in greek as 'sand-soda.' this is again melted and forms pure glass, and is indeed a lump of clear colourless glass. nowadays sand is similarly blended also in the gallic and spanish provinces. there is a story that in the reign of tiberius there was invented a method of blending glass so as to render it flexible. the artist's workshop was completely destroyed for fear that the value of metals such as copper, silver and gold would otherwise be lowered. such is the story, which, however, has for a long period been current through frequent repetition rather than authentic. but this is of little consequence, seeing that in nero's principate there was discovered a technique of glass-making that resulted in two quite small cups of the kind then known as 'petroti' or 'stoneware' fetching a sum of 6000 sesterces.
