by the augustan canal the padus is carried to ravenna, at which place it is called the padusa, having formerly borne the name of messanicus. the nearest mouth to this spot forms the extensive port known as that of vatrenus, where claudius caesar, on his triumph over the britons, entered the adriatic in a vessel that deserved rather the name of a vast palace than a ship. this mouth, which was formerly called by some the eridanian, has been by others styled the spinetic mouth, from the city of spina, a very powerful place which formerly stood in the vicinity, if we may form a conclusion from the amount of its treasure deposited at delphi; it was founded by diomedes. at this spot the river vatrenus, which flows from the territory of forum corneli, swells the waters of the padus.
