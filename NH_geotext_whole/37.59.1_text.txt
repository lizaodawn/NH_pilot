'galaxias,' or 'milk stone,' which is sometimes known as 'galactites,' is similar to the stones next mentioned, but is traversed by blood-red or white streaks. 'galactitis' is entirely milk-white, and is known also as 'leucogaea' ('white earth'), 'leucographitis' ('white chalk'), and 'synechitis' ('cohesive earth'). it is noteworthy for the fact that when rubbed between the fingers it exhibits a milky smear and flavour, and in the rearing of children it ensures wet-nurses a plentiful flow of milk. moreover, when it is tied to the necks of babies as an amulet, it is said to make their saliva flow, but we are told that when placed in the mouth it melts and also causes loss of memory. two rivers, the nile and the achelous, produce this substance. some people apply the term 'galactites' to a 'smaragdus' that is banded with white streaks. 'gallaica' is similar to 'argyrodamas,' but is somewhat less pure. two or three stones are found joined together. the 'gassinnades,' which comes from media, has the colour of wild vetch and looks as if it were sprinkled with flowers. it is found also at arbela. this is yet another gem that is said to conceive, and to betray the presence of the stone in its womb if it is shaken. the 'embryo,' we are told, takes three months to develop. 'glossopetra,' or 'tongue stone,' which resembles the human tongue, does not, we are told, form in the ground, but falls from the sky during the waning of the moon, and is indispensable to the moon-diviner. our scepticism with regard to this account is reinforced by the falseness of the claim made for the stone; for it is stated that it checks gales. the 'gorgonia,' or 'gorgon's stone,' is merely coral. the reason for its name is that it is transformed into the hardness of stone after being softened in the sea. it is said to keep off thunderbolts and whirlwinds. the 'goniaea,' or 'faceted stone,' is guaranteed just as falsely to bring about the punishment of one's private enemies.
