the macedonians have given accounts of kinds of trees that for the most part have no names. there is also one that resembles the terebinth in every other respect but the fruit of which is like an almond, though smaller, and is remarkably sweet, at all events when grown in bactria. this tree has been considered by some persons to be a special kind of terebinth rather than another plant resembling it. the tree from which they make linen for clothing resembles a mulberry by its leaves, but the calyx of the fruit is like that of a dog-rose. it is grown in the plains, and no other plantations add more to the beauty of the landscape.
