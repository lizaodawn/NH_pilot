the people of egypt stain their silver so as to see portraits of their god anubis in their vessels; and they do not engrave but paint their silver. the use of that material thence passed over even to our triumphal statues, and, wonderful to relate, its price rises with the dimming of its brilliance. the method adopted is as follows: with the silver is mixed one third its amount of the very line cyprus copper called chaplet-copper and the same amount of live sulphur as of silver, and then they are melted in an earthenware vessel smeared round with potter's clay; the heating goes on till the lids of the vessels open of theft own accord. silver is also turned black by means of the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, although the black can be rubbed off with vinegar and chalk.
