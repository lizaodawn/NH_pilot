the 'bee-vine' is so called because bees are specially fond of it. it has two varieties, which also are covered with down in the young state; the difference between them is that one ripens more quickly than the other, although the latter also ripens fast. these vines do not object to cold situations, and nevertheless no others rot more quickly from rain. the wines made from them are sweet at first but acquire roughness in the course of years. in etruria this vine flourishes more than any other.
