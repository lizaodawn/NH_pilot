sapling trees have no fruit as long as they are growing. the trees most liable to lose their fruit before it ripens are the palm, the fig, the almond, the apple and the pear, and also the pomegranate, which excessive dew and frost cause to lose its flower as well. in consequence of this people bend down its branches, lest if they shoot straight upright they may receive and retain the moisture which is injurious to them. the pear and almond lose their blossom even if it does not rain but a south wind sets in or the sky is cloudy, and if that sort of weather has prevailed after they have shed their blossom, they lose their first fruit. but it is the willow that loses its seed most quickly, before it approaches ripeness at all. this is the reason why homer gives it the epithet 'fruit-losing'; but succeeding ages have interpreted the meaning of the word in the light of its own wicked conduct, inasmuch as it is well known that willow seed taken as a drug produces barrenness in a woman. but nature, showing her foresight in this matter also, has been rather careless about bestowing seed on a tree that is propagated easily even a planted sprig. it is said however that one variety of willow usually carries its seed till it ripens; this grows on the island of crete just by the path coming down from the cave of jupiter; it has a hard woody seed of the size of a chick-pea.
