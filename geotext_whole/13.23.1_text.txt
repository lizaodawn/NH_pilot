the process of making paper from papyrus is to split it with a needle into very thin strips made as broad as possible, the best quality being in the centre of the plant, and so on in the order of its splitting up. the first quality used to be called 'hieratic paper' and was in early times devoted solely to books connected with religion, but in a spirit of flattery it was given the name of augustus, just as the second best was called 'livia paper' after his consort, and thus the name 'hieratic' came down to the third class. the next quality had been given the name of 'amphitheatre' paper, from the place of its manufacture. this paper was taken over by the clever workshop of fannius at rome, and its texture was made finer by a careful process of insertion, so that it was changed from common paper into one of first-class quality, and received the name of the maker; but the paper of this kind that did not have this additional treatment remained in its own class as amphitheatre paper. next to this is the saitic paper named from the town where it is produced in the greatest abundance, being made from shavings of inferior quality, and the taeneotic, from a neighbouring place, made from material still nearer the outside skin, in the case of which we reach a variety that is sold by mere weight and not for its quality. as for what is called 'emporitic' paper, it is no good for writing but serves to provide covers for documents and wrappers for merchandise, and consequently takes its name from the greek word for a merchant. after this comes the actual papyrus, and its outermost layer, which resembles a rush and is of no use even for making ropes except those used in water.
