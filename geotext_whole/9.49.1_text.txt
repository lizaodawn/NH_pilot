mucianus has stated that he has also seen in the dardanelles another creature resembling a ship under sail: it is a shell with a keel like a boat, and a curved stern and beaked bow. in this (he says) the nauplius, a creature like the cuttlefish, secretes itself, merely by way of sharing the game. the manner in which this takes place is twofold: in calm weather the carrier shell strikes the water by dipping its flappers like oars, but if the breezes invite, the same flappers are stretched out to serve as a rudder and the curves of the shells are spread to the breeze. the former creature delights (he continues) to carry and the latter to steer, and this pleasure penetrates two senseless things at once - unless perhaps human calamity forms part of the motive, for it is an established fact that this is a disastrous omen for mariners.
