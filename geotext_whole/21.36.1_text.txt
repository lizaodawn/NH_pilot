nyctegreton was one of a few plants chosen for special admiration by democritus; it is of a dark-red colour, with a leaf like a thorn, and not rising high from the ground; a special kind grows in gedrosia. he reports that it is pulled up by the roots after the spring equinox and dried in the moonlight for thirty days; that after this it glows at night, and that the magi and the kings of parthia use the plant to make their vows. it is also called, he says, chenamyche, because geese are panic-stricken at the first sight of it, and by others nyctalops, because it gleams a long distance by night.
