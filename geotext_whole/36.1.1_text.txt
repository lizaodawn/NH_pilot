it remains for us to deal with the nature of stones, or, in other words, the prime folly in our behaviour, to be considered as such even though no reference be made to gems, amber and vessels of rock-crystal and fluorspar. for everything that we have investigated up to the present volume may be deemed to have been created for the benefit of mankind. mountains, however, were made by nature for herself to serve as a kind of framework for holding firmly together the inner parts of the earth, and at the same time to enable her to subdue the violence of rivers, to break the force of heavy seas and so to curb her most restless elements with the hardest material of which she is made. we quarry these mountains and haul them away for a mere whim; and yet there was a time when it seemed remarkable even to have succeeded in crossing them. our forefathers considered the scaling of the alps by hannibal and later by the cimbri to be almost unnatural. now these selfsame alps are quarried into marble of a thousand varieties.
