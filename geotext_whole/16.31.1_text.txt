the cypress, walnut, chestnut and laburnum dislike water. the last is another alpine tree, and is not generally known; its wood is hard and white and its flower, which is half a yard long, bees will not touch. the shrub called jupiter's beard, used in ornamental gardening and clipped into a round bushy shape, and having a silvery leaf, also dislikes water. willows, alders, poplars, the silera and the privet, the last extremely useful for making tallies, will only grow in places where there is water, and the same is the ease with the whortleberry, grown in bird-snares in italy, but in gaul also to supply purple dye for slaves' clothes. all the trees that are common to the mountains and the plains grow larger and finer to look at when in flat country, but those on the mountains grow better fruit and make timber with a wavier grain, excepting the apples and pears.
