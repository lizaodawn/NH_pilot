upon the gulf of doris we have leucopolis, hamaxitos, eleus, and euthene. we then come to pitaium, eutane, and halicarnassus, towns of caria. to the jurisdiction of this last place six towns were appended by alexander the great, theangela, sibde, medmassa, uranium [ms. euralium], pedasus, and telmissus. [halicarnassus] lies between two gulfs, those of ceramus and iasus. we then come to myndos, and the former site of palaeomyndos; also nariandos, neapolis, caryanda, the free town of termera, bargyla, and the town of iasus, from which the iasian gulf takes its name.
