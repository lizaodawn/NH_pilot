the first gold statue of all that was made of solid metal and even before any was made of bronze, of the kind called 'made of solid beaten metal,' is said to have been erected in the temple of anaitis, in the region of the earth where we have designated this name, that goddess' deity being held in the highest reverence by those races. this statue was taken as booty during the campaigns of [c. 36 b.c.] antonius in parthia, and a story is told of a witty saying of one of the veterans of our army who was being entertained as a guest at dinner by his late lamented majesty augustus at bononia. he was asked whether it was true that the man who was the first to commit this sacrilege against that deity was struck blind and paralysed and so expired. his answer was that the emperor was at that very moment eating his dinner off one of the goddess's legs, and that he himself was the perpetrator of the sacrilege and owed his entire fortune to that piece of plunder. the first solid gold statue of a human being was one of himself set up by gorgias of leontini in the temple at delphi about the 70th olympiad. so great were the profits to be made by teaching the art of oratory!
