fruits that must be included in the class of apples and pears are the medlar and the service-berry. there are three sorts of medlar, the anthedon, the setania, and the third an inferior kind yet rather like the anthedon, which is called the gallic medlar. the fruit of the setania is larger and of a paler colour, with a softer pip; the others have smaller fruit but with a superior scent and keeping longer. the tree itself is one of the most widely spreading; its leaves turn red before they fall off; it has a great many roots, which go deep into the ground and consequently it is impossible to grub them up. in cato's time this tree did not exist in italy.
