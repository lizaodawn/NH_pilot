liburnia and illyricum: the nation of the liburni adjoins the river arsia, and extends as far as the river titus. the mentores, the hymani, the encheleae, the buni, and the people whom callimachus calls the peucetiae, formerly formed part of it; but now the whole in general are comprised under the one name of illyricum. but few of the names of these nations are worthy of mention, or indeed very easy of pronunciation. to the jurisdiction of scardona resort the iapydes and fourteen cities of the liburni, of which it may not prove tedious if i mention the lacinienses, the stlupini, the burnistae, and the olbonenses. belonging to the same jurisdiction there are, in the enjoyment of italian rights, the alutae, the flanates, from whom the gulf takes its name, the lopsi, and the varvarini; the assesiates, who are exempt from tribute; and upon the islands, the fertinates and the curiattae.
