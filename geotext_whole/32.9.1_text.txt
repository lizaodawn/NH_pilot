nor are these the last among the marvels we know of fishes: that they are bitter near the island of pele and near clazomenae, over against the rock of sicily, leptis in africa, euboea, and dyrrhachium; and again, so salt that they might be thought pickled, off cephallania, ampelos, paros and the rocks of delos; while in the harbour of delos they are sweet. these differences depend without a doubt on the food. apion tells us that the largest of the fishes is the pig-fish, which the lacedemonians call onhagoriscus, saying that it grunts when it is caught. that this accident of nature, however (to increase our wonder), is also met with in certain localities, is suggested by a ready example, seeing that salted foods of every kind, as is well known, at beneventum in italy have to be resalted.
