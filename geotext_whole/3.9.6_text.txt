at this spot begins that blessed country campania, and in this vale first take their rise those hills clad with vines, the juice of whose grape is extolled by fame all over the world; the happy spot where, as the ancients used to say, father liber and ceres are ever striving for the mastery. hence the fields of setia and of caecubum extend afar, and, next to them those of falernum and of calinum. as soon as we have passed these, the hills of massica, of gaurus, and of surrentum rise to our view. next, the level plains of laborium are spread out far and wide, where every care is bestowed on cultivating crops of spelt, from which the most delicate fermenty is made. these shores are watered by warm springs, while the seas are distinguished beyond all others for the superlative excellence of their shell and other fish. in no country too has the oil of the olive a more exquisite flavour. this territory, a battle-ground as it were for the gratification of every luxurious pleasure of man, has been held successively by the osci, the greeks, the umbri, the tusci, and the campani.
