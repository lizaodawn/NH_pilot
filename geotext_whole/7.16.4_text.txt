it is known that at the age of three a person's measurement is half his future stature. but it is almost a matter of observation that with the entire human race the stature on the whole is becoming smaller daily, and that few men are taller than their fathers, as the conflagration that is the crisis towards which the age is now verging is exhausting the fertility of the semen. when a mountain in crete was cleft by an earthquake a body 69 feet in height was found, which some people thought must be that of orion and others of otus. the records attest that the body of orestes dug up at the command of an oracle measured 10 ft. 6 in. moreover, the famous bard homer nearly 1000 years ago never ceased to lament that mortals were smaller of stature than in he old days. in the case of naevius pollio the annals do not record his height, but they show that was deemed portentous, because he was almost killed by the people flocking round him. the tallest person our age has seen was a man named gabbara brought from arabia in the principate of his late majesty claudius who was 9 ft. 9 in. in height. under his late majesty augustus there were two persons 6 in. taller, whose bodies on account of this remarkable height were preserved in the tomb in sallust's gardens; their names were pusio and secundilla. when the same emperor was head of the state the smallest person was a dwarf 2 ft. 5 in. high named conopas, the pet of his granddaughter julia, and the smallest female was andromeda, a freed-woman of julia augusta. marcus varro states that the knights of rome manius maximus and marcus tullius were 3 ft. high, and we have ourselves men their bodies preserved in coffins. it is a matter of common knowledge that persons are born 18 in. high and some taller, who complete their life's course at the age of three.
