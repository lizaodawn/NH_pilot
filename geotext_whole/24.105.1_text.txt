another plant highly popular among the greeks is the stratiotes, but it grows only in egypt when the nile is in flood; it is like the aizoum, only its leaves are larger. it is wonderfully cooling, and applied in vinegar heals wounds, as well as erysipelas and suppurations. it also arrests haemorrhage of the kidneys in a marvellous way if taken in drink with male frankincense.
