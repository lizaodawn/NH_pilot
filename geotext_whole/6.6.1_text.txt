the cimmerian bosporus: the length of the peninsula which projects between the euxine and lake maeotis, is not more than sixty-seven miles and a half, and the width across never less than two jugera: it has the name of eion. the shores of the bosporus then take a curve both on the side of europe and of asia, thus forming the maeotis. the towns at the entrance of the bosporus are, first hermonassa, next cepi, founded by the milesians, and then stratoclia and phanagoria, and the almost deserted town of apaturos, and, at the extremity of the mouth, cimmerium, which was formerly called cerberion. (7.) we then come to lake maeotis, which has been already mentioned in the description of europe.
