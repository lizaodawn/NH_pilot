nowhere are more serviceable millstones to be found than in italy, for here they are proper stones and not lumps of rock. in certain provinces, however, they are not found at all. some stones of this kind are quite soft and can be smoothed also with a whetstone, so that from a distance they may be mistaken for serpentine. no other stones are more durable than millstones; for, as with wood, it is characteristic of stones of one sort or another to be unable to stand rain, sun or wintry weather. some are affected even by the moon, while others acquire a patina in course of time or lose their white colour when treated with oil.
