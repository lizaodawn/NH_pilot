the food of bees is of so much importance that even their honey may become poisonous. at heraclia in pontus the honey turns out in certain years very deadly, and that from the same bees. as the authorities have not said from what flowers this honey is extracted, i will myself put on record what i have ascertained. there is a plant which, from its deadly effect even on cattle, more particularly upon goats, is called aegolethron. from the blossom of this, when it withers in a rainy spring, bees take in a noxious poison. thus it happens that it is not in all years that the danger is encountered. the signs of poisonous honey are that it does not thicken at all, its colour inclines to red, its smell is strange and at once causes sneezing, and it is heavier than harmless honey. cattle which have eaten it throw themselves on the ground, seeking to cool themselves, for they actually drip with sweat.
