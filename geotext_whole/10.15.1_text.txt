whereas all the other birds of the same class drive their chicks out of the nests and compel them to fly, as also do ravens. these not only feed on flesh themselves too, but also drive away their chicks when strong to a considerable distance. consequently in small villages there are not more than two pairs of ravens, and in fact in the neighbourhood of crannon in thessaly there is one pair permanently in each place; the parents retire to make room for their offspring.
