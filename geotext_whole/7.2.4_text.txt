beyond the nasamones and adjacent to them calliphanes records the machlyes, who are adrogyni and perform the function of either sex alternately. aristotle adds that their left breast is that of a man and their right breast that of a woman. isogonus and nymphodorus report that there are families in the same part of africa that practise sorcery, whose praises cause meadows to dry up, trees to wither and infants to perish. isogonus adds that there are people of the same kind among the triballi and the illyrians, who also bewitch with a glance and who kill those they stare at for a longer time, especially with a look of anger, and that their evil eye is most felt by adults; and that what is more remarkable is that they have two pupils in each eye. apollonides also reports women of this kind in scythia, who are called the bitiae, and phylarchus also the thibii tribe and many others of the same nature in pontus, whose distinguishing marks he records as being a double pupil in one eye and the likeness of a horse in the other, and he also says that they are incapable of drowning, even when weighed down with clothing. damon records a tribe not unlike these in ethiopia, the pharmaces, whose sweat relieves of diseases bodies touched by it. also among ourselves cicero states that the glance of all women who have double pupils is injurious everywhere. in fact when nature implanted in man the wild beasts' habit of devouring human flesh, she also thought fit to implant poisons in the whole of the body, and with some persons in the eyes as well, so that there should be no evil anywhere that was not present in man.
