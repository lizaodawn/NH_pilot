the next most famous bronze was the aiginetan; and the island of aigina itself became celebrated for it, though not because the metal copper was mined there but because of the compounding done in the workshops. a bronze ox looted from aigina stands in the cattle-market at rome, and will serve as a specimen of aigina bronze, while that of delos is seen in the zeus or jupiter in the temple of jupiter the thunderer on the capitol. aigina bronze was used by myron and that from delos by polyclitus, who were contemporaries and fellow-pupils; thus there was rivalry between them even in their choice of materials.
