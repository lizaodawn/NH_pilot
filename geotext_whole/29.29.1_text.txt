beneficial too is ash of hen's dung applied, the liver of a python, a lizard or a mouse torn open, the scorpion laid on the wound it has itself inflicted, or roasted and taken in food or in two cyathi of neat wine. scorpions are peculiar in that they do not sting the palm of the hand or touch any but hairy parts. a pebble of any kind, if the part next the ground is laid on the wound, relieves the pain, and a potsherd too is said to be a cure if a part covered with earth is applied just as it was taken up - those making the application must not look back, and must take care that the sun does not behold them - and another cure is an application of pounded earthworms. many other remedies are obtained from earthworms, so they are kept in honey for this purpose. the night owl is an enemy of bees, wasps, hornets, and leeches, and those are not stung by them who carry about their person a beak of the woodpecker of mars. hostile to them are also the smallest of the locusts, which are wingless and called attelebi. there is also a venomous kind of ant, not generally found in italy. cicero calls it solipuga and in baetica it is called salpuga. a bat's heart is hostile to these, as it is to all ants. i have said that cantharides are hostile to salamanders.
