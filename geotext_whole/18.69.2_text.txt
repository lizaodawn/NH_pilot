these are two in number, in addition to that depending on the moon, and they are situated in only a few quarters of the heavens. for the pleiades specially concern farm produce, inasmuch as their rising marks the beginning of summer and their setting that of winter, embracing in the six months' space between them the harvest and vintage and ripening of all vegetation. and the sky also contains the constellation called the milky way, which is also easily recognized a by observing two others, the eagle in the northern region and in the southern the little dog, which we have mentioned in its proper place. the milky way itself passes through the archer and the twins, cutting the equinoctial orbit twice at the sun's centre-point, the intersections being marked by the eagle on .one side and the little dog on the other. consequently the influences of each of these constellations reach to all cultivated lands, inasmuch as these are the only points at which the centres of the sun and earth correspond. consequently if on the dates of these constellations the atmosphere is clear and mild and transmits this genial milky juice to the lands of the earth, the crops grow luxuriantly; but if the moon scatters a dewy cold after the manner previously described, the admixture of bitterness, like sourness in milk, kills off the infant offspring. the measure of this injury in various countries is that occasioned in each part of earth's convex surface by the combination of each of these two causes, and so it is not perceived simultaneously in the whole of the world, as daybreak is not either. we have said that the eagle rises in italy on december 20, and nature's system does not permit any of the crops sown to be of certain promise before that day; but if the moon happens then to be in conjunction, all the winter and early spring produce is bound to suffer damage.
