up to this point the goodness of a wine is credited to the countries of its growth. among the greeks, the wine they have called 'life' has justly won a very distinguished name, having been developed for the treatment of a great many maladies, as we shall show in the part of our work dealing with medicine. the process of making it is this: the grapes are picked a little before they are ripe and are dried in a fierce sun, being turned three times a day for three days, and on the fourth day they are put through the press and then left in casks to mature in the sun. the people of cos mix in a rather large quantity of seawater - a custom arising from the peculation of a slave who used this method to fill up the due measure, and this mixture is poured into white must, producing what is called in greek 'white coan.' in other countries a blend made in a similar way is called 'sea-flavoured wine,' and 'sea-treated' when the vessels containing the must have been thrown into the sea; this is a kind of wine that matures young. also with us as well cato exhibited a method of making coan wine out of italian, his most important instruction being that it must be left in the sun for four years to ripen. the rhodes vintage resembles that of cos, but the phorinean is salter. all the overseas wines are thought to take seven years to reach the middle stage of maturity.
