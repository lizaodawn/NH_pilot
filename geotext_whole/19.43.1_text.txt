it might bethought that all the vegetables of value had now been mentioned, did not there still remain an extremely profitable article of trade, which must be mentioned not without a feeling of shame. the fact is it is well known that at carthage and particularly at cordova crops of thistles yield a return of 6000 sesterces from small plots - since we turn even the monstrosities of the earth to purposes of gluttony, and actually grow vegetables which all four-footed beasts without exception shrink from touching. thistles then we grow in two ways, from a slip planted in autumn and from seed sown before march 7, the seedlings from which are planted out before november 13, or in cold localities about the season of the west wind. they are sometimes manured as well, if heaven so wills, and come up more abundantly. they are also preserved in honey diluted with vinegar, with the addition of laser-wort root and cummin, so that there may be no day without thistles for dinner.
