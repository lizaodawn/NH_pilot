crete: crete itself lies from east to west, the one side facing the south, the other the north, and is known to fame by the renown of its hundred cities. dosiades says, that it took its name from the nymph crete, the daughter of hesperides; anaximander, from a king of the curetes, philistides of mallus; while crates says that it was at first called aeria, and after that curetis; and some have been of opinion that it had the name of macaron from the serenity of its climate. in breadth it nowhere exceeds fifty miles, being widest about the middle. in length, however, it is full 270 miles, and 589 in circumference, forming a bend towards the cretan sea, which takes its name from it. at its eastern extremity is the promontory of sammonium, facing rhodes, while towards the west it throws out that of criumetopon, in the direction of cyrene.
