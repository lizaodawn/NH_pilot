people seeking for gold begin by getting up segellum - that is the name for earth that indicates the presence of gold. this is a pocket of sand, which is washed, and from the sediment left an estimate of the vein is made. sometimes by a rare piece of luck a pocket is found immediately, on the surface of the earth, as occurred recently in dalmatia when nero was emperor, one yielding fifty pounds weight of gold a day. gold found in this way in the surface crust is called talutium if there is also auriferous earth underneath. the otherwise dry, barren mountains of the spanish provinces which produce nothing else whatever are forced into fertility in regard to this commodity.
