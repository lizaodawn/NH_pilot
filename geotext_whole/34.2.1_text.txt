the method followed in mining deposits of copper and purifying the ore by firing is that which has been stated. the metal is also got from a coppery stone called by a greek name cadmea, a kind in high repute coming from overseas and also formerly found in campania and at the present day in the territory of bergomum on the farthest confines of italy; and it is also reported to have been recently found in the province of germany. in cyprus, where copper was first discovered, it is also obtained from another stone also, called chalcitis, copper ore; this was however afterwards of exceptionally low value when a better copper was found in other countries, and especially gold - copper, which long maintained an outstanding quality and popularity, but which for a long time now has not been found, the ground being exhausted. the next in quality was the sallustius copper, occurring in the alpine region of haute savoic, though this also only lasted a short time; and after it came the livia copper in gaul: each was named from the owners of the mines, the former from the friend of augustus and the latter from his wife. livia copper also quickly gave out: at all events it is found in very small quantity. the highest reputation has now gone to the marius copper, also called cordova copper; next to the livia variety this kind most readily absorbs cadmea and reproduces the excellence of gold-copper in making sesterces and double-as pieces, the single as having to be content with its proper cyprus copper. that is the extent of the high quality contained in natural bronze and copper.
