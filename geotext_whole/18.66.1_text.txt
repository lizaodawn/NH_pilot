the vernal equinox appears to end on march 25. between that day and the morning rising of the pleiades the first of april according to caesar indicates bad weather. the pleiades set on the evening of april 3 in attica and on the day after in boeotia, but for caesar and the chaldeans on april 5, when for egypt orion and his sword begin to set. the setting of the scales on april 8 according to caesar announces rain. in the evening the little pigs, a stormy constellation bringing boisterous weather on land and sea, sets for egypt on april 18; it sets on april 16 for attica and april 17 for caesar, indicating four successive days of bad weather, but on the 20th for assyria. this constellation is commonly called parilicium, because april 21, the birthday of the city of rome, on which fine weather usually returns, has given a clear sky for observing the heavens, although because of the clouds that it brings with it the greek name for the constellation is hyades, which our countrymen, owing to the similarity of the greek name supposed in their ignorance to have been given it with reference to the word for 'pigs', and so have called the stars the little pigs. in caesar's calendar april 24 is also a marked day. on april 25 the kids rise for egypt, and on april 26 the dog sets in the evening and the lyre rises in the morning for boeotia and attica. on april 27 orion entirely disappears for assyria, and on the 28th the dog. on may 2 the little pigs rise in the morning for caesar, and on may 8 the she-goat, portending rain, while the dog sets for egypt in the evening of the same day. that is a fairly precise account of the movements of the constellations down to may 10, which is the date of the rising of the pleiades.
