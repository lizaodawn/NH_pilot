of the rest of the date kind the syrian variety, called sweetmeats, seem to be a low-class fruit; for those in the other part of phoenicia and cilicia have the local name of acorn-dates, also used by us. these too are of several kinds, differing in shape, some rounder and others longer, and also in colour, some being blacker and others reddish; indeed, they are reported to have as many varieties of colour as the fig! though the white ones are the most in favour. they also differ in size, many having reached half a yard in length while some are no larger than a bean. the best kinds for keeping are those that grow in salt and sandy soils, for instance in judea and the cyrenaic district of africa; the dates in egypt, cyprus, syria and seleucia in assyria do not keep, and consequently are used for fattening swine and other stock. it is a sign that the fruit is spoilt or old if the white excrescence by which the dates are attached to the cluster has fallen off. soldiers of alexander were choked by eating green dates; this effect was produced in the gedrosi country by the quality of the fruit, and occurs elsewhere from eating it to excess, for fresh dates are so sweet that people will not stop eating them except because of the danger.
