the whole of this country has successively had the names of aetheria, atlantia, and last of all, aethiopia, from aethiops, the son of vulcan. it is not at all surprising that towards the extremity of this region the men and animals assume a monstrous form, when we consider the changeableness and volubility of fire, the heat of which is the great agent in imparting various forms and shapes to bodies. indeed, it is reported that in the interior, on the eastern side, there is a people that have no noses, the whole face presenting a plane surface; that others again are destitute of the upper lip, and others are without tongues. others again, have the mouth grown together, and being destitute of nostrils, breathe through one passage only, imbibing their drink through it by means of the hollow stalk of the oat, which there grows spontaneously and supplies them with its grain for food. some of these nations have to employ gestures by nodding the head and moving the limbs, instead of speech. others again were unacquainted with the use of fire before the time of ptolemy lathyrus, king of egypt. some writers have also stated that there is a nation of pygmies, which dwells among the marshes in which the river nile takes its rise; while on the coast of, aethiopia, where we paused, there is a range of mountains, of a red colour, which have the appearance of being always burning.
