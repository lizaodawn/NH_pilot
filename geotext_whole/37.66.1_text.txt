the 'panchrus,' or 'stone of all colours,' is composed of almost every colour. 'pangonus,' or all-angles, is no longer than a finger, and it is only its more numerous plane faces that prevent it from being taken for rock-crystal. as for the 'paneros,' or 'all-love,' metrodorus does not describe it, but he as cites quite a tasteful poem on the stone composed by queen timaris and dedicated to venus. in this poem it is implied that the stone helped her to bear children. some people call it 'panerastos,' or 'loved-by-all.' the pontic stone occurs in several varieties. it is spangled sometimes with blood-red, sometimes with golden spots, and is regarded as a supernatural object. one variety has, instead of stars, similarly coloured lines, and another, figures recalling mountains and deep valleys. the 'phloginos,' or 'flame-coloured stone,' which is also known as 'chrysitis,' or 'gold stone,' resembles the yellow ochre of attica and is found in egypt. the 'phoenicitis,' or 'date-palm stone,' is so called from its resemblance to a date, and the 'phycitis,' or 'seaweed stone,' from its similarity to seaweed. a stone is 'perileucos,' or 'white-around,' when a white line descends (in a spiral) from the margin to the very base of the stone. the 'paeanis,' or 'apollo stone,' otherwise known as 'gaeanis,' the 'earth stone,' is said to become pregnant and to give birth to another stone, and so is thought to relieve labour pains. its birthplace is in macedonia, near the tomb of tiresias, and its appearance is that of ice.
