lenaeus calls the myrice (tamarisk) erica (heath), comparing it to the brooms of ameria . he says that boiled in wine, beaten up with honey, and applied to cancerous sores it heals them. some authorities consider it to be the same as tamarice. but it is specific for splenic trouble if its juice is extracted and drunk in wine; so wonderful do they make out its antipathy to be to this internal organ, and to this only, that they affirm that if pigs drink out of troughs made of this wood they are found to be without a spleen. and for that reason they give to a man also, if he has an enlarged spleen, food and drink in vessels made of tamarisk. a respected medical authority, moreover, has asserted that a twig, broken off from it without its touching the ground or iron, relieves bellyache, if it be so applied as to be pressed to the body by the tunic and the girdle. the common people, as i have said, call this tree unlucky, because it bears no fruit and never is planted.
