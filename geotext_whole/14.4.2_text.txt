the highest rank is given to the vines of aminaea, account of the body of that wine and its life, which undoubtedly improves with age. there are five varieties of these vines; of these the 'younger sister' with a smaller berry sheds its blossom better! and can stand rain and stormy weather, which is not the case with the 'elder sister,' though this is less liable to damage when trained on a tree than when on a frame. the 'twin sisters,' which have got this name because the bunches always grow in pairs, give a wine with a very rough flavour but of exceptional strength; the smaller of these 'twins' is damaged by a south wind, but the other winds give it nutriment, for instance on mount vesuvius and the hills of sorrento, but in all other parts of italy it only flourishes when trained on trees. the fifth kind is the 'woolly' grape - for, to prevent our being very much surprised at the chinese or the indians, it is covered with a coat of down. it ripens first of the aminaean grapes, and decays the most quickly.
