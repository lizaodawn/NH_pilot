but the country in the neighbourhood of carthage claims by the name of punic apple what some call the pomegranate; this it has also split up into classes, by giving the name of apyrenum to the variety that lacks a woody kernel: the consistency of this is whiter than that of the others, and its pips have a more agreeable taste and the membranes enclosing them are not so bitter; but in other respects these apples have a special structure resembling the cells in a honeycomb, which is common to all that have a kernel. of these there are five kinds, the sweet, the sour, the mixed, the acid and the vinous; those of samos and of egypt are divided into the red-leaved and the white-leaved varieties. the skin of the unripe fruit is specially used for dressing leather. the flower is called balaustium, and is serviceable for doctors and also for dyeing cloth; it has given its name to a special colour.
