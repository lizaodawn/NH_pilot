thrace; the aegean sea. thrace now follows, divided into fifty strategies, and to be reckoned among the most powerful nations of europe. among its peoples whom we ought not to omit to name are the denseletae and the medi, dwelling upon the right bank of the strymon, and joining up to the bisaltae above mentioned; on the left there are the digerri and a number of tribes of the bessi, with various names, as far as the river mestus, which winds around the foot of mount pangaion, passing among the elethi, the diobessi, the carbilesi; and then the brysae, the sapaei, and the odomanti. the territory of the odrysae gives birth to the hebrus, its banks being inhabited by the cabyleti, the pyrogeri, the drugeri, the caenici, the hypsalti, the beni, the corpili, the bottiaei, and the edoni. in the same district are also the selletae, the priantae, the doloncae, the thyni, and the greater coeletae, below mount haemus, the lesser at the foot of rhodope. between these tribes runs the river hebrus. we then come to a town at the foot of rhodope, first called poneropolis, afterwards philippopolis from the name of its founder, and now, from the peculiarity of its situation, trimontium. to reach the summit of haemus you have to travel six miles. the sides of it that look in the opposite direction and slope towards the ister are inhabited by the moesi, the getae, the aorsi, the gaudae, and the clariae; below them, are the arraei sarmatae, also called arreatae, the scythians, and, about the shores of the euxine, the moriseni and the sithonii, the forefathers of the poet orpheus, dwell.
