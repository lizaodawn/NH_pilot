who could make an honours class-list of geniuses, ranging through all the kinds of systems and all the varieties of subject and of treatment? unless perhaps it is agreed that no genius has ever existed who was more successful than homer the bard of greece, whether he be judged by the form or by the matter of his work. consequently alexander the great - for so lordly an assessment will be effected best and least invidiously by the most supreme tribunals - when among the booty won from the persian king darius there was a case of unguents made of gold and enriched with pearls and precious stones, and when his friends pointed out the various uses to which it could be put, since a warrior soiled with warfare had no use for perfume, said, 'no, by hercules, rather let it be assigned to keeping the works of homer' - so that the most precious achievement of the mind of man might be preserved in the richest possible product of the craftsman's art. alexander also gave orders at the sack of thebes for the household and home of the poet pindar to be spared; and he felt the native place of the philosopher aristotle to be his own, and blended that evidence of kindliness with all the glory of his exploits. apollo at delphi exposed the murderers of the poet archilochus. when sophocles the prince of the tragic buskin died [406 bc] father liber gave orders for his burial though the spartans were besieging the city walls, the spartan king lysander receiving frequent admonitions in dreams 'to permit the interment of the darling of the god.' the king enquired what persons had expired at athens and had no difficulty in understanding which among them the god meant, and he granted an armistice for the funeral.
