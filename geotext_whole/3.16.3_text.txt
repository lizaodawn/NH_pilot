at this point begins apulia, surnamed the daunian, from the daunii, who take their name from a former chief, the father-in-law of diomedes. in this territory are the towns of salapia, famous for hannibal's amour with a courtezan, sipontum, uria, the river cerbalus, forming the boundary of the daunii, the port of agasus, and the promontory of mount garganus, distant from the sallentinepromontory or iapygia 234 miles. making the circuit of garganus, we come to the port of garna, the lake pantanus, the river frento, the mouth of which forms a harbour, teanum of the apuli, and larinum, cliternia, and the river tifernus, at which the district of the frentani begins. thus there were three different nations of the apulians, [the daunii, ] the teani, so called from their leader, and who sprang from the greeks, and the lucani, who were subdued by calchas, and whose country is now possessed by the atinates. besides those already mentioned, there are, of the daunii, the colonies of luceria and venusia, the towns of canusium and arpi, formerly called argos hippium and founded by diomedes, afterwards called argyrippa. here too diomedes destroyed the nations of the monadi and the dardi, and the two cities of apina and trica, whose names have passed into a by-word and a proverb.
