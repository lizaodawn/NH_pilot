the remaining parts of syria: we must now speak of the interior of syria. coele syria has the town of apamea, divided by the river marsyas from the tetrarchy of the nazerini; bambyx, the other name of which is hierapolis, but by the syrians called mabog, (here the monster atargatis, called derceto by the greeks, is worshipped); and the place called chalcis on the belus, from which the region of chalcidene, the most fertile part of syria, takes its name. we here find also cyrrhestice, with cyrrhum, the gazatae, the gindareni, the gabeni, the two tetrarchies called granucomatae, the emeseni, the hylatae, the nation of the ituraei, and a branch of them, the people called the baetarreni; the mariamnitani, the tetrarchy known as mammisea, paradisus, pagrae, the pinelitae, two cities called seleucia, besides the one already mentioned, the one seleucia on the euphrates, and the other seleucia on the belus, and the tardytenses. the remaining part of syria (except those parts which will be spoken of in conjunction with the euphrates) contains the arethusii, the beroeenses, and the epiphanaeenses; and on the east, the laodiceni, who are called the laodiceni on the libanus, the leucadii, and the larissaei, besides seventeen other tetrarchies, divided into kingdoms and bearing barbarous names.
