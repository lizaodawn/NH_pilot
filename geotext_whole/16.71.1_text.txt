among water-plants, in a class of their own but of a bushy nature, are also brambles, and so are elders, which are of a spongy nature, though in a different way from the giant fennel, as at all events the elder has more wood; a shepherd believes that a horn or trumpet of elder wood will be louder if the wood was cut in some place where the elder bush is out of hearing of the crowing of cocks. brambles bear blackberries, and one variety, which is called in greek the dog-bramble, a flower like a rose. a third kind the greeks call the ida bramble, from the place where it grows, a more slender variety than the others, with smaller and less hooked thorns; its blossom is used to make an ointment for sore eyes, and also, dipped in honey, for st. anthony's fire, and also soaked in water it makes a draught to cure stomach troubles. elder-trees have small black berries with a sticky juice, chiefly med for a hair dye; these also are boiled in water and eaten.
