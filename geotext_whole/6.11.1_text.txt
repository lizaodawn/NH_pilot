albania, iberia, and the adjoining nations: the whole plain which extends away from the river cyrus is inhabited by the nation of the albani, and, after them, by that of the iberi, who are separated from them by the river alazon, which flows into the cyrus from the caucasian chain. the chief cities are cabalaca, in albania, harmastis, near a river of iberia, and neoris; there is the region also of thasie, and that of triare, extending as far as the mountains known as the paryadres. beyond these are the deserts of colchios, on the side of which that looks towards the ceraunian mountains dwell the armenochalybes; and there is the country of the moschi, extending to the river iberus, which flows into the cyrus; below them are the sacassani, and after them the macrones, upon the river absarus. such is the manner in which the plains and low country are parcelled out. again, after passing the confines of albania, the wild tribes of the silvi inhabit the face of the mountains, below them those of the lubieni, and after them the diduri and the sodii.
