i shall speak about those greek fellows in can their proper place, son marcus, and point out the result of my enquiries at athens, and convince you what benefit comes from dipping into their literature, and not making a close study of it. they are a quite worthless people, and an intractable one, and you must consider my words prophetic. when that race gives us its literature it will corrupt all things, and even all the more if it sends hither its physicians. they have conspired together to murder all foreigners with their physic, but this very thing they do for a fee, to gain credit and to destroy us easily. they are also always dubbing us foreigners, and to fling more filth on us than on others they give us the foul nickname of opici. i have forbidden you to have dealings with physicians.
