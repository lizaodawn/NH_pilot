the liquor that follows is thicker, and now produces pitch; this in its turn is collected in copper cauldrons and thickened by means of vinegar, as making it coagulate, and it has been given the name of bruttian pitch; it is only useful for casks and similar receptacles, and differs from other pitch by its viscosity and also by its reddish colour and because it is greasier than all the rest. it is made from pitch-resin caused to boil by means of red-hot stones in casks made of strong oak, or, if casks are not available, by piling up a heap of billets, as in the process of making charcoal. it is this pitch which is used for seasoning wine after being beaten up into a powder like flour, when it has a rather black colour. the same resin, if rather gently boiled with water and strained off, becomes viscous and turns a reddish colour; this is called 'distilled pitch.' for making this the inferior parts of the resin and the bark of the tree are usually set aside. another mixing process produced 'intoxication resin': raw flower of resin is picked off the tree with a quantity of thin, short chips of the wood, and broken up small in a sieve, and then steeped in water heated to boiling. the grease of this that is extracted makes the best quality of resin, and it is rarely obtainable, and only in a few districts of italy near the alps. it is suitable for medical use: the doctors boil â¾ of a gallon of white resin in 1 1/2 gallons of rainwater - though others think it pays better to boil it without water over a slow fire for a whole day, and to employ a vessel of white copper, or to boil resin from the turpentine-tree in a flat pan on hot ashes, as they prefer this to all the other kinds. the resin of the mastich is rated next.
