all gold contains silver in various proportions, a tenth part in some cases, an eighth in others. in one mine only, that of callaecia called the albucrara mine, the proportion of silver found is one thirty-sixth, and consequently this one is more valuable than all the others. wherever the proportion of silver is one-fifth, the ore is called electrum; grains of this are found in 'channelled' gold. an artificial electrum is also made by adding silver to gold. if the proportion of silver exceeds one-fifth, the metal produced offers no resistance on the anvil. electrum also held a high position in old times, as is evidenced by homer who represents the palace of menelaus as resplendent with gold, electrum, silver and ivory. there is a temple of athena at lindus of the island of rhodes in which there is a goblet made of electrum, dedicated by helen; history further relates that it has the same measurement as her breast. a quality of electrum is that it shines more brightly than silver in lamp-light. natural electrum also has the property of detecting poisons; for semicircles resembling rainbows run over the surface in poisoned goblets and emit a crackling noise like fire, and so advertise the presence of poison in a twofold manner.
