polybius has stated, that in a straight line from the straits of gades to the mouth of the maeotis, it is a distance of three thousand four hundred and thirty-seven miles and a half, and that, starting from the same point, the distance in a straight line to sicily is twelve hundred and fifty miles, from thence to crete three hundred and seventy-five, to rhodes one hundred and eighty-seven and a half, to the chelidonian islands the same distance, to cyprus two hundred and twenty-five, and from thence to seleucia pieria, in syria, one hundred and fifteen miles: the sum of all which distances amounts to two thousand three hundred and forty miles. agrippa estimates this same distance, in a straight line from the straits of gades to the gulf of issos, at three thousand three hundred and forty miles; in which computation, however, i am not certain that there is not some error in the figures, seeing that the same author has stated that the distance from the straits of sicily to alexandria is thirteen hundred and fifty miles. taking the whole length of the sea-line throughout the gulfs above-mentioned, and beginning at the same point, he makes it ten thousand and fifty-eight miles; to which number artemidorus has added seven hundred and fifty-six: the same author, including in his calculation the shores of the maeotis, makes the whole distance seventeen thousand three hundred and ninety miles. such is the measurement given by men who have penetrated into distant countries, unaided by force of arms, and have, with a boldness that exhibits itself in the times of peace even, challenged, as it were, fortune herself.
