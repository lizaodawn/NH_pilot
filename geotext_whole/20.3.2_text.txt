as to this cucumber itself, those who sing its praises tell us that the best variety grows in arabia, and the next best in arcadia; some report that in cyrene grows a cucumber like the heliotrope, of the size of a walnut, appearing between the leaves and the branches; its seed is curled back like a scorpion's tail but white in colour. moreover, some call this cucumber 'scorpion'; both its seed and elaterium are most effective antidotes to the sting of the scorpion. the regular dose as purge or emetic is from half to one obolus, according to the idiosyncrasy of the patient, a larger dose being fatal. similar are the doses when taken in drink as a remedy for phthiriasis and dropsy. mixed with honey or old olive oil it is used to cure quinsy and tracheal affections.
