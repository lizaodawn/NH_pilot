the coast of illyricum is clustered with more than 1000 islands, the sea being of a shoaly nature, and numerous creeks and aestuaries running with their narrow channels between portions of the land. the more famous are those before the mouths of the timavus, with warm springs that rise with the tides of the sea, the island of cissa near the territory of the istri, and the pullaria and absyrtides, so called by the greeks from the circumstance of absyrtus, the brother of medea, having been slain there. some islands near them have been called the electrides, upon which amber, which they call "electrum," was said to be found; a most assured instance however of that untruthfulness which is generally ascribed to the greeks, seeing that it has never yet been ascertained which of the islands were meant by them under that name. opposite to the iader is lissa, and other islands whose names have been already mentioned. opposite to the liburni are some islands called the crateae, and no smaller number styled liburniecae and celadussae. opposite to surium is bavo, and brattia, famous for its goats, issa with the rights of roman citizens, and pharia with a town. at a distance of twenty-five miles from issa is corcyra melaena, with a town founded by the cnidians; between which and illyricum is melite, from which, as we learn from callimachus, a certain kind of little dogs were called melitaei; fifteen miles from it we find the seven elaphites. in the ionian sea, at a distance of twelve miles from oricum, is sasonis, notorious from having been a harbour of pirates.
