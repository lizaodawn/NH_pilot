in trees of this class there is also a difference corresponding to their native countries. the most highly spoken of grow on the alps and the apennines, on the jura and vosges mountains of gaul, in corsica, bithynia, pontus and macedonia. the firs of aenia and arcadia are inferior, and those of parnassus and euboea the worst, because in those places they are branchy and twisted and the wood is apt to rot. as for the cedar, those in crete, africa and syria are the most highly spoken of. timber well smeared with cedar oil does not suffer from maggot or decay. the juniper has the same excellence as the cedar; this tree grows to a great size in spain and especially in the territory of the vaccaei; the heart of its timber is everywhere even more solid than that of the cedar. a general fault of all timber is what is called cross-grain, when the veins and knots have grown twisted. in some trees are found centres like those in marble, that is hard pieces like a nail, unkind to the saw; and there are some hardnesses due to accident, as when a stone, or the branch of another tree, has been caught in a hollow and taken into the body of the tree. it is said that stones found inside trees serve as a preventive against abortion. in the market-place at megara long stood a wild olive tree on which brave warriors had hung their weapons; these in the course of time had been hidden by the bark growing round them; and on this tree depended the fate of the city, an oracle having prophesied that it would be destroyed when a tree gave birth to arms - which happened to this tree when it was cut down, greaves and helmets being found inside it.
