along the coast of the inland sea is the town of barbesula with its river; also salduba; the town of suel; and then malaca, with its river, one of the federate towns. next to this comes maenoba, with its river; then sexifirmum, surnamed julium; selambina; abdera; and murgi, which is at the boundary of baetica. m. agrippa supposed that all this coast was peopled by colonists of punic origin. beyond the anas, and facing the atlantic, is the country of the bastuli and the turditani. m. varro informs us, that the iberians, the persians, the phoenicians, the celts, and the carthaginians spread themselves over the whole of spain; that the name "lusitania" is derived from the games (lusus) of father bacchus, or the fury (lyssa) of his frantic attendants, and that pan was the governor of the whole of it. but the traditions respecting hercules and pyrene, as well as saturn, i conceive to be fabulous in the highest degree.
