with the greatest justice, however, we may lavish our praises upon alexandria, built by alexander the great on the shores of the egyptian sea, upon the soil of africa, at twelve miles' distance from the canopic mouth and near lake mareotis; the spot having previously borne the name of rhacotes. the plan of this city was designed by the architect dinochares, who is memorable for the genius which he displayed in many ways. building the city upon a wide space of ground fifteen miles in circumference, he formed it in the circular shape of a macedonian chlamys, uneven at the edge, giving it an angular projection on the right and left; while at the same time he devoted one-fifth part of the site to the royal palace.
