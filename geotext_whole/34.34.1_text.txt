cyprus ash is the best. it is produced when cadmea and copper ore are melted. the ash in question is the lightest part of the whole substance produced by blasting, and it flies out of the furnaces and adheres to the roof, being distinguished from soot by its white colour. such part of it as is less white is an indication of inadequate firing; it is this that some people call 'bubble.' but the redder part selected from it has a keener force, and is so corrosive that if while it is being washed it touches the eyes it causes blindness. there is also an ash of the colour of honey, which is understood to indicate that it contains a large amount of copper. but any kind is made more serviceable by washing; it is first purified with a strainer of cloth and then given a more substantial washing, and the rough portions are picked out by the fingers. when it is washed with wine it is particularly powerful. there is also some difference in the kind of wine used, as when it is washed with weak wine it is thought to be less serviceable for eye-salves, and at the same time more efficacious for running ulcers or for ulcers of the mouth that are always wet and more useful for all the antidotes for gangrene. an ash called lanriotis is also produced in furnaces in which silver is smelted; but the kind said to be most serviceable for the eyes is that which is formed in smelting gold. nor is there any other department in which the ingenuities of life are more to be admired, inasmuch as to avoid the need of searching for metals experience has devised the same utilities by means of the commonest things.
