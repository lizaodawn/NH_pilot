but on the vatican hill there is a holm-oak that is older than the city; it has a bronze tablet on it with an inscription written in etruscan characters, indicating that even in those days the tree was deemed venerable. the people of tivoli also date their origin far before the city of rome; and they have three holm-oaks still living that date even earlier than their founder tiburnus, the ceremony of whose installation is said to have taken place near them; but tradition relates that he was the son of amphiaraus, who died in battle before thebes a generation before the trojan war.
