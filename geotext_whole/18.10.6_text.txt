when cereals have finished flowering, they gradually swell and ripen in 40 days at most, and the same is the case with the bean, but the chick-pea ripens in the fewest days, as it is completely ready in 40 days from sowing. millet (common and italian) and gingelly and all the summer grains ripen within 40 days of blossoming, although with considerable differences due to soil and weather; for in egypt barley is reaped in the sixth month after sowing and wheat in the seventh, while in greece barley is cut in the seventh month and in the peloponnese in the eighth, and wheat even later. grains growing on a stalk form ears with a texture like a tuft of hairs; in beans and leguminous plants the grains are in pods shooting on each side alternately. cereals are stronger to withstand winter, but the leguminous plants provide a more substantial article of food.
