cyperos is a rush such as i have already described, with three corners, white next the ground, dark and fleshy at the head. the bottom leaves are more slender than those of leeks, the top ones being very small, with the seed between them. the root resembles that of the dark olive, which when it is oblong is called cyperis, being widely used in medicine. the most valued cyperos comes from the region round the temple of hammon, the second in esteem from rhodes, the third from thera, the last from egypt; as the cypiros also grows there, some confusion of thought results. but cypiros has a very hard root and scarcely any smell; the species of true cyperos have a smell that closely resembles that of nard. there is also a separate indian plant called cypira, in shape resembling ginger, which when chewed tastes like saffron. the use of cyperos in medicine is to act as a depilatory. it makes an ointment for hang-nails, sores of the genitals and all sores that are in moisture, such as those in the mouth. its root affords an effective remedy for the bites of snakes and stings of scorpions. the root taken in drink opens the passage of the uterus, but if taken in too strong doses its potency is great enough to cause prolapsus. it promotes urine and the passing of stone, and therefore is most useful to sufferers from dropsy. it is applied to spreading sores, but especially to those of the gullet, either in wine or in vinegar.
