nor can we suppose that scaurus surprised with an elementary lesson in vice a community that was untutored and unable to foresee the consequences of the mischief. it was before this that during a quarrel the orator lucius crassus, having been the first to install, also on the palatine, columns of foreign marble, columns which were after all merely of hymettus marble and not more than six in number or more than 12 feet each in length, was in consequence nicknamed by marcus brutus the palatine venus. of course these matters were disregarded because morals had already lost the battle; and when it was seen that there was no effective way of banning what had been expressly forbidden, it seemed preferable to have no laws at all rather than laws that were of no avail. these events and those that have followed them in our time will show that we are better men. for who nowadays possesses a hall equipped with such large columns? however, before we speak of marbles, i am of the opinion that we should display the merits of the men who have worked in this material. first, then, we shall make a survey of artists.
