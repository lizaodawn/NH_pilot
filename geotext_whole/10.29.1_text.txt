to the goose kind belong the sheldrake and the barnacle-goose, the latter the most sumptuous feast that britain knows; both are rather smaller than the goose. the black grouse also makes a fine show with its gloss and its absolute blackness, with a touch of bright scarlet above the eyes. another variety of these exceeds the size of vultures and also reproduces their colour, nor is there any bird except the ostrich that attains a greater weight of body, growing to such a size that it is actually caught motionless on the ground. they are a product of the alps and the northern region. when kept in fishponds they lose their flavour, and obstinately hold their breath till they die. next to these are the birds that spain calls tardae and greece otides, which are condemned as an article of diet, because when the marrow is drained out of their bones a disgusting smell at once follows.
