the country on the banks of the tigris is called parapotamia; we have already made mention of mesene, one of its districts. dabithac is a town there, adjoining to which is the district of chalonitis, with the city of ctesiphon, famous, not only for its palm-groves, but for its olives, fruits, and other shrubs. mount zagrus reaches as far as this district, and extends from armenia between the medi and the adiabeni, above paraetacene and persis. chalonitis is distant from persis three hundred and eighty miles; some writers say that by the shortest route it is the same distance from assyria and the caspian sea.
