famous plane-frees are: (1) one that grew in the walks of the academy at athens, the roots of which were 50 feet long and spread wider than the branches; (2) at the present day there is a celebrated plane in lycia, allied with the amenity of a cool spring; it stands by the roadside like a dwelling-house with a hollow cavity inside it 81 feet across, forming with its summit a shady grove, and shielding itself with vast branches as big as trees and covering the fields with its long shadows, and so as to complete its resemblance to a grotto, embracing inside it mossy pumice-stones in a circular rim of rock - a tree so worthy to be deemed a marvel that licinius mucianus, who was three times consul and recently lieutenant-governor of the province, thought it worth handing down to posterity also that he had held a banquet with eighteen members of his retinue inside the tree, which itself provided couches of leafage on a bounteous scale, and that he had then gone to bed in the same tree, shielded from every breath of wind, and receiving more delight from the agreeable sound of the rain dropping through the foliage than gleaming marble, painted decorations or gilded panelling could have afforded. (3) another instance is connected with the emperor caligula, who on an estate at velletri was impressed by the flooring of a single plane-tree, and benches laid loosely on beams consisting of its branches, and held a banquet in the tree - himself constituting a considerable portion of the shadow than a dining-room large enough to hold fifteen guests and the servants: this dining-room the emperor called his 'nest.' (4) there is a single plane-free at the side of a spring at gortyn in the island of crete which is celebrated in records written both in greek and latin, as never shedding its leaves; and a typical greek story about it has come down from early times, to the effect that underneath it jupiter lay with europa - just as if really there were not another tree of the same species in the island of cyprus! slips from this tree, however, planted first in crete itself - so eager is human nature for a novelty - reproduced the defect: for defect it was, because the plane has no greater recommendation than its property of warding off the sun in summer and admitting it in winter. during the principate of claudius an extremely wealthy thessalian eunuch, who was a freedman of marcellus aeserninus but had for the sake of obtaining power got himself enrolled among the freedmen of the emperor, imported this variety of plane-tree from crete into italy and introduced it at his country estate near rome - so that he deserves to be called another dionysius! and these monstrosities from abroad still last on in italy also, in addition, that is, to those which italy has devised for herself.
