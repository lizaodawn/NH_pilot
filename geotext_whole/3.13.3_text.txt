the most celebrated peoples of this island are the ilienses, the balari, and the corsi; and among its eighteen towns, there are those of the sulcitani, the valentini, the neapolitani, the bosenses, the caralitani, who enjoy the rights of roman citizens, and the norenses. there is also one colony which is called ad turrim libysonis. timaeus has called this island sandaliotis, on account of the similarity of its shape to the sole of a shoe, while myrtilus has given it the name of ichnusa, from its resemblance to the print of a footstep. opposite to the gulf of paestum is leucasia, so called from a siren who is buried there; opposite to velia are poiitia and isacia, both known by one name, that of oenotrides, a proof that italy was formerly possessed by the oenotrians. opposite to vibo are the little islands called ithacesiae from the watch-tower of ulysses situate there.
