if conjunctions should coincide with the shortest day of the winter solstice, the timber produced lasts for ever; and the next best is when the conjunction coincides with the constellations mentioned above. some people add the rising of the dog-star also, and say that this was how the timber used for the forum of augustus was felled. but trees that are neither quite young nor old are the most useful for timber. another plan not without value is followed by some people, who make a cut round the trees as far as the pith and then leave them standing, so that all the moisture may drain out of them. it is a remarkable fact that in old days in the first punic war the fleet commanded by duilius was on the water within 60 days after the timber left the tree, while, according to the account of lucius piso, the 220 ships that fought against king hiero were built in 45 days; also in the second punic war scipio's fleet sailed on the 40th day after the timber had been felled. so effective is prompt action even in the hurry of an emergency.
