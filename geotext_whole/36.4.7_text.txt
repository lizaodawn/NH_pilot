the contemporaries and rivals of scopas were bryaxis, timotheus and leochares, whom we must discuss along with him because together with him they worked on the carvings of the mausoleum. this is the tomb that was built by artemisia for her husband mausolus, the viceroy of caria, who died in the second year of the 107th olympiad. these artists were chiefly responsible for making the structure one of the seven wonders of the work. on the north and south sides it extends for 63 feet, but the length of the facades is less, the total length of the facades and sides being 440 feet. the building rises to a height of 25 cubits and is enclosed by 36 columns. the greek word for the surrounding colonnade is 'pteron,' a 'wing.' the east side was carved by scopas, the north by bryaxis, the south by timotheus and the west by leochares; and before they completed their task, the queen died. however, they refused to abandon the work without finishing it, since they were already of the opinion that it would be a memorial to their own glory and that of their profession; and even today they are considered to rival each other in skill. with them was associated a fifth artist. for above the colonnade there is a pyramid as high again as the lower structure and tapering in 24 stages to the top of its peak. at the summit there is a four-horse chariot of marble, and this was made by pythis. the addition of this chariot rounds off the whole work and brings it to a height of 140 feet. there is a diana by timotheus at rome in the temple of the palatine apollo, a statue for which a head was made as a replacement by avianius evander.
