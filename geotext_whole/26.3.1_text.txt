this plague was unknown to our fathers and forefathers. it first made its way into italy in the middle of the principate of tiberius claudius caesar, when a roman knight of perusia, a quaestor's secretary, introduced the infection from asia minor, where he had taken up his duties. women were not liable to the disease, or slaves and the lower and middle classes, but the nobles were very much infected through the momentary contact of a kiss. the scar left on many who had been hardy enough to endure the treatment was more unsightly than the disease, for caustics were the method employed, and the loathsome complaint broke out afresh unless the flesh was burnt through right to the bones. there arrived from egypt, the parent of such diseases, physicians who devoted all their attention to this complaint only, to their very great profit, since it is a fact that manilius cornutus, of praetorian rank and legate of the province of aquitania, laid out two hundred thousand sesterces in getting himself treated for that disease. on the other hand, it has more usually happened that new kinds of disease on their first appearance have been epidemic. what can be found more marvellous than this, that some diseases should arise suddenly in a special part of the world, should attack special limbs of human beings or special ages, or even people of a special position in life, (just as if a plague chose its victims), one children, another adults, one making the nobility especially liable, another the poor.
