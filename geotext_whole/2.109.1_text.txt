naphtha is of a similar nature - this is the name of a substance that flows out like liquid bitumen in the neighbourhood of babylon and the austacenis area of parthia. naphtha has a close affinity with fire, which leaps to it at once when it sees it in any direction. this is how medea in the legend burnt her rival, whose wreath caught fire after she had gone up to the altar to offer sacrifice.
