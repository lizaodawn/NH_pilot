mosaics came into use as early as sulla's regime. at all events, there exists even today one made of very small cubes which he installed in the temple of fortune at praeneste. after that, ordinary tessellated floors were driven from the ground level and found a new home in vaulted ceilings, being now made of glass. here too we have a recent invention. at any rate, agrippa, in the baths that he built at rome, painted the terracotta work of the hot rooms in encaustic and decorated the rest with whitewash, although he would certainly have built vaults of glass if such a device had already been invented or else had been extended from the walls of a stage, such as that of scaurus which we have described, to vaulted ceilings. and so we must now proceed to explain also the nature of glass.
