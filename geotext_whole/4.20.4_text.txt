belonging to hellas, but still in the aegean sea, we have the lichades, consisting of scarphia, coresa, phocaria, and many others which face attica, but have no towns upon them, and are consequently of little note. opposite eleusis, however, is the far-famed salamis; before it, psyttalia; and, at a distance of five miles from sounion, the island of helene. at the same distance from this last is ceos, which some of our countrymen have called cea, and the greeks hydrussa, an island which has been torn away from euboea. it was formerly 500 stadia in length; but more recently four-fifths of it, in the direction of boeotia, have been swallowed up by the sea. the only towns it now has left are iulis and carthaea; coresus and poeeessa have perished. varro informs us, that from this place there used to come a cloth of very fine texture, used for women's dresses.
