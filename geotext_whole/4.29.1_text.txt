ninety-six islands of the gallic ocean. in the rhine itself, nearly 100 miles in length, is the most famous island of the batavi and the canninefates, as also other islands of the frisii, the chauci, the frisiabones, the sturii, and the marsacii, which lie between helium and flevum. these are the names of the mouths into which the rhine divides itself, discharging its waters on the north into the lakes there, and on the west into the river mosa. at the middle mouth which lies between these two, the river, having but a very small channel, preserves its own name.
