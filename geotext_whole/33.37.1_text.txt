theophrastus states that cinnabar was discovered by an athenian named callias, 90 years before the archonship of praxibulus at [405 b.c.] athens - this date works out at the 349th year of our city, and that callias was hoping that gold could by firing be extracted from the red sand found in silver mines; and that this was the origin of cinnabar, although cinnabar was being found even at that time in spain, but a hard and sandy kind, and likewise in the country of the colchi on a certain inaccessible rock from which the natives dislodged it by shooting javelins, but that this is cinnabar of an impure quality whereas the best is found in the cilbian territory beyond ephesus, where the sand is of the scarlet colour of the kermes-insect; and that this is ground up and then the powder is washed and the sediment that sinks to the bottom is washed again; and that there is a difference of skill, some people producing cinnabar at the first washing while with others this is rather weak and the product of the second washing is the best.
