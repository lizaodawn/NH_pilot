we must not omit one extremely exceptional case. in the territory of naples a knight of rome named corellius, a native of este, grafted a chestnut with a slip cut from the tree itself, and this is how the celebrated variety of chestnut tree named after him was produced. subsequently his freedman tereus grafted a corellius chestnut again. the difference between the two varieties is this: the former is more prolific but the latter, the tereus chestnut, of better quality.
