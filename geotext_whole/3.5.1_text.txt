of the province of gallia narbonensis: that part of the gallias which is washed by the inland sea is called the province of [gallia] narbonensis, having formerly borne the name of braccata. it is divided from italy by the river varus, and by the range of the alps, the great safeguards of the roman empire. from the remainder of gaul, on the north, it is separated by the mountains cebenna and jura. in the cultivation of the soil, the manners and civilization of the inhabitants, and the extent of its wealth, it is surpassed by none of the provinces, and, in short, might be more truthfully described as a part of italy than as a province. on the coast we have the district of the sordones, and more inland that of the consuarani. the rivers are the tecum and the vernodubrum. the towns are illiberis, the scanty remains of what was formerly a great city, and ruscino, a town with latin rights. we then come to the river atax, which flows from the pyrenees, and passes through the rubrensian lake, the town of narbo martius, a colony of the tenth legion, twelve miles distant from the sea, and the rivers arauris and liria. the towns are otherwise but few in number, in consequence of the numerous lakes which skirt the sea-shore. we have agatha, formerly belonging to the massilians, and the district of the volcae tectosages; and there is the spot where rhoda, a rhodian colony, formerly stood, from which the river takes its name of rhodanus; a stream by far the most fertilizing of any in either of the gallias. descending from the alps and rushing through lake lemanus, it carries along with it the sluggish arar, as well as the torrents of the isara and the druentia, no less rapid than itself. its two smaller mouths are called libica, one being the spanish, and the other the metapinian mouth; the third and largest is called the massiliotic. there are some authors who state that there was formerly a town called heraclea at the mouth of the rhodanus or rhone.
