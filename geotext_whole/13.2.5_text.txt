under this heading it will be suitable to recall that we mentioned nine species of plants that resemble the indian nard: such a large supply of material is available for purposes of adulteration. they can all be rendered more pungent by the addition of costus and amomum, which have an extremely powerful scent, and thicker in consistency and sweeter by means of myrrh, while their utility for medicine is increased by adding saffron; but they will be rendered extremely penetrating in themselves by means of amomum - this actually causes headache. some people hold it enough to add a sprinkle of the most expensive ingredients to the others after boiling them down, as an economy, but the mixture has not the same strength unless they are all boiled down together. myrrh even when used by itself without oil makes an unguent, provided that the staete kind is used - otherwise it produces too bitter a flavour. unguent of cyprus produces a green colour, lily unguent gives a greasy consistency, oil of mendes makes the mixture black, attar of roses white, and myrrh gives a pale hue.
