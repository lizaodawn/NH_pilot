rhodes. but the fairest of them all is the free island of rhodes, 125, or, if we would rather believe isidorus, 103 miles in circumference. it contains the inhabited cities of lindos, camirus, and ialysus, now called rhodos. it is distant from alexandria in egypt, according to isidorus, 583 miles; but, according to eratosthenes, 469. mucianus says, that its distance from cyprus is 166. this island was formerly called ophiussa, asteria, aethria, trinacrie, corymbia, poeeessa, atabyria, from the name of one of its kings; and, in later times, macaria and oloessa. the islands of the rhodians are carpathus, which has given its name to the surrounding sea; casos, formerly known as achne [hagne?]; eulimna, nisyros, twelve miles distant from cnidos, and formerly called porphyris; and, in the same vicinity, midway between rhodes and cnidos, syme. this island is thirty-seven miles and a half in circumference, and welcomes us with eight fine harbours. besides these islands, there are, in the vicinity of rhodes, those of cyclopis, teganon, cordylussa, the four islands called diabetae, hymos, chalce, with its city of that name, teutlusa, narthecusa, dimastos, progne; and, off cnidos, cisserussa, therionarcia, and calydna with three towns, notium, nisyros, and mendeterus. in arconnesus there is the town of ceramus. off the coast of caria, there are the islands known as the argiae, twenty in number; also hyetussa, lepsia, and leros.
