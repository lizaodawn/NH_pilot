the chief reason for the collapse of buildings in rome is the purloining of lime, as the result of which the rough stones are laid on each other without any proper mortar. it is also a fact that the slurry improves with keeping. in the old building laws is to be found a regulation that no contractor is to use a slurry that is less than three years old. consequently, old plaster work was never disfigured by cracks. stucco never possesses the required brilliance unless three coats of sand mortar and two of marble stucco are laid on. buildings exposed to damp or erected in a locality where they may be affected by moisture from the sea may with profit be given an undercoat of plaster made from pounded potsherds. in greece sand mortar for plaster work is, furthermore, worked up in a trough with wooden poles before it is spread. the test for ascertaining that marble stucco has been worked to the correct consistency is that it should no longer stick to the trowel, while in whitewashing the test is that the slaked lime should stick like glue. slaking should always be carried out when the lime is in lumps. at elis there is a temple of minerva in which, it is said, panaenus, the brother of pheidias, applied plaster that had been worked with milk and saffron. the result is that even today, if one wets one's thumb with saliva and rubs it on the plaster, the latter still gives off the smell and taste of saffron.
