there is a plant very like cummin which the greeks call ami. some authorities however consider that it is ethiopian cummin. hippocrates called it royal cummin, doubtless because he thought that it was more efficacious than the egyptian. most people think that it is of an entirely different nature from cununin, because it is thinner and whiter. yet its use is similar to that of cummin, for it is put under loaves of bread at alexandria and included among the ingredients of alexandrian sauces. it dispels flatulence and griping, promotes urine and menstruation, relieves bruises and fluxes of the eyes, and taken in wine with linseed in doses of two drachmae it is good for the wounds of scorpions, and with an equal proportion of myrrh it is especially good for the bite of the cerastes. like cummin it produces pallor in the complexion of those who drink it. a fumigation of it with raisins or resin acts as a purge upon the womb. it is believed that those women more easily conceive who smell the plant during sexual intercourse.
