sicily: but more celebrated than all is sicily, called sicania by thucydides, and by many writers trinacria or trinacia, from its triangular appearance. according to agrippa it is 618 miles in circumference. in former times it was a continuation of the territory of bruttium, but, in consequence of the overflowing of the sea, became severed from it; thus forming a strait of 15 miles in length, and a mile and a half in width in the vicinity of the pillar of rhegium. it was from this circumstance of the land being severed asunder that the greeks gave the name of rhegium to the town situate on the italian shore.
