the citron or assyrian apple, called by others the median apple, is an antidote against poisons. it has the leaves of the strawberry-tree, but with prickles running among them. for the rest, the actual fruit is not eaten, but it has an exceptionally strong scent, which belongs also to the leaves, and which penetrates garments stored with them and keeps off injurious insects. the tree itself bears fruit at all seasons, some of the apples falling while others are ripening and others just forming. because of its great medicinal value various nations have tried to acclimatize it in their own countries, importing it in earthenware pots provided with breathing holes for the roots (and similarly, as it will be convenient to record here so that each of my points may be mentioned only once, all plants that are to travel a specially long distance are planted as tightly as possible for transport); but it has refused to grow except in media and persia. it is this fruit the pips of which, as we have mentioned, the parthian grandees have cooked with their viands for the sake of sweetening their breath. and among the medes no other tree is highly commended.
