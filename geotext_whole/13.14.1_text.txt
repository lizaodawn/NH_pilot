egypt also has many kinds of trees not found anywhere else, before all a fig, which is consequently called the egyptian fig. the tree resembles a mulberry in foliage, size and appearance; it bears its fruit not on the branches but on the trunk itself, and this is an exceedingly sweet fig without seeds inside it. there is an extremely prolific yield, but only if incisions are made in the fruit with iron hooks, otherwise it does not ripen; but when this is done, it can be plucked three days later, another fig forming in its place, the tree thus scoring seven crops of extremely juicy figs in a summer. even if the incisions are not made new fruit forms under the old and drives out its predecessor before it is ripe four times in a summer. the wood of this fig is of a peculiar kind, and is one of the most useful there is. as soon as it is cut it is plunged into a marsh, and at first sinks to the bottom, but afterwards begins to float, and it is clear that moisture not belonging to it, which soaks into all other timber, drains the sap out of this. when it begins to float on the surface, this is its sign that the timber is ready for use.
