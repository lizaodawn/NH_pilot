indeed it is constituted on a supreme principle of excellence, as we have said, in a variety of ways. in some places honeycombs distinguished for their wax are formed, as in sicily and the abruzzi, in other places for quantity of honey, as in crete, cyprus, africa, in others for size, as in the northern countries, a comb having before now been seen in germany that was 8 ft. long, and black in its hollow part. yet in any region there are three kinds of honey. there is spring honey with the comb made from flowers, which is consequently called flower-honey. some people say this ought not to be touched, so that a progeny made strong by plentiful nourishment may be produced; but others leave less of this honey than of any other kind for the bees, on the ground that a great profusion follows at the rising of the great stars, and also at the solstice, when thyme and grapevines begin to flower, the outstanding material for the cells. it is however necessary to practice economy in taking away the combs, as lack of food causes the bees to despair and die or fly away, and on the other hand a large supply brings sloth, and then the bees feed on the honey and not on bee-bread; consequently the more careful beekeepers leave a fifteenth part of this vintage to the bees. the day fixed for beginning by a sort of law of nature, if only men would know or keep it, is the thirtieth after the leading out of the swarm; and this vintage usually falls within the month of may.
