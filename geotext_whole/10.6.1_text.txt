at the city of sestos the fame of an eagle is celebrated, the story being that it was reared by a maiden and that it repaid its gratitude by bringing to her first birds and soon afterwards big game, and when finally she died it threw itself upon her lighted pyre and was burnt with her. on account of this the inhabitants made what is called a heroon in that place, which is named the shrine of jupiter and the maiden, because the bird is assigned to that deity.
