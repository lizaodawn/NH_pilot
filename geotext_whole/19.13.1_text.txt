peculiarities reported about truffles are that they spring up when there have been spells of rain in autumn and repeated thunderstorms, and that thunderstorms bring them out particularly; that they do not last beyond a year; and that those in spring are the most delicate to eat. in some places acceptable truffles only grow in marshy places, for instance at mytilene it is said that they only grow on ground flooded by the rivers, when the floods have brought down seed from tiara: that is the place where most grow. the most famous asiatic truffles grow round lampsacus and alopeconnesus, and the most famous greek ones in the district of elis.
