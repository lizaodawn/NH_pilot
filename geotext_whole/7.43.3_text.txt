quintus metellus, in the panegyric that he delivered at the obsequies of his father lucius metellus the pontiff, who had been consul twice, dictator, master of the horse and land-commissioner, and who was the first person who led a procession of elephants in a triumph, having captured them in the first punic war, has left it in writing that his father had achieved the ten greatest and highest objects in the pursuit of which wise men pass their lives: for he had made it his aim to be a first-class warrior, a supreme orator and a very brave commander, to have the direction of operations of the highest importance, to enjoy the greatest honour, to be supremely wise, to be deemed the most eminent member of the senate, to obtain great wealth in an honourable way, to leave many children, and to achieve supreme distinction in the state; and that these things had fallen to his father's lot, and to that of no one else since rome's foundation. it would be a lengthy matter to refute this, and it is superfluous to do so as it is abundantly rebutted by a single accidental misfortune: inasmuch as this metellus passed an old age of blindness, having lost his sight in a fire when saving the statue of pallas from the temple of vesta, a memorable purpose but disastrous in its result. consequently though he must not be pronounced unhappy, still he cannot be called happy. the nation bestowed on him a privilege given to no one else since the foundation of time, permission to ride to the senate-house in a chariot whenever he went to a meeting of the senate - a great and highly honourable privilege, but one that was bestowed on him as a substitute for sight.
